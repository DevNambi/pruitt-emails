For Immediate Release

COLUMN - Outside Four Walls: A Case for Religious Liberty
By Attorney General Scott Pruitt,
One of the many things I treasure about this country is our right to debate, discuss and discern
what the founders of this great nation meant by “inalienable rights.” As we approach
Christmas, stories of city officials stripping religion from holiday displays or schools axing
“Silent Night” from elementary programs have once again spiked. The Founding Fathers did
not intend our laws and Constitution to restrict, prevent or condemn our right to exercise our
faith. They sought to protect it.
A few years ago, while on a trip to Romania, I visited a small Baptist church in the rural town
of Timisoara. As I waited in the back of the church with the pastor, I noticed the photos of
pastors hanging on the wall and asked him if Christian services were allowed under the
country’s former communist regime. “Oh, yes,” he assured me, “we could worship as long as
it stayed within the four walls of the church. If we went outside to tell what we learned, we
were persecuted.”
As if on cue, a small elderly woman walked up to me, held out her hands and took mine
between them. With tears in her eyes, she whispered “I love America.”
This frail woman had never been to our country, she didn’t know its laws, she was unaware of
its politics, but there she was – crying and expressing thanks. She and the pastor understood
something that many of us take for granted – America represents opportunity, values and the
freedom to practice our faith outside of the four walls of a church.
Publicly practicing our religion is something we should not fear in this country, and yet I’ve
read story after story about a toy drive shut down because the beneficiary was a Christian
children’s charity or a school banning Christmas music at its “winter” program even though
the Courts have upheld their inclusion in school productions. This year, the U.S. Air Force
Academy made “So help me God” optional in its oath after threat of a lawsuit, and just last
month Costco department stores were forced to apologize after their supplier labeled Bibles as
fiction.
We’re not living in China or Iran or North Korea, and we do not face the same harsh
punishment for practicing religion, but we must stand up for our faith and we need to be vocal
about our concerns.
Our Founders’ commitment to freedom was built on fundamental rights, including freedom of
speech and religion. These liberties were of such importance they were included in the First
Amendment, not the fifth or sixth. It is understood that these rights are inherent and
unalienable and do not come from a constitution or laws or any government, but from God.
Feb-17-2017 006089

When religious liberty was first debated on the House floor in the late 1700s, representatives
expressed concern that the wording of the First Amendment could lead to the abolishment of
religion altogether. James Madison, the principle author of the Bill of Rights, assured them
that the First Amendment simply meant that Congress should not “establish a religion” or in
effect endorse a particular denomination at the expense of others, or “enforce the legal
observation of it by law.” That it represented freedom to believe and freely exercise our faith
unencumbered by government mandate or restraint.
So, let us not forget during this Christmas season as we celebrate with our families, our cities,
our schools and our places of worship that religion is not a silent practice confined to four
walls, but an opportunity to live out our faith in the public square.

OCPA's latest study presents a comprehensive plan
to save Oklahoma's retirement systems.

WHO'S COUNTING?
$130 million
Amount of the seven-year
contract outfielder Shin-Soo
Choo signed with the Texas
Rangers after turning down a
seven-year, $140 million offer
from the New York Yankees.
Sports Illustrated reports that
"a big reason Choo agreed to
go to the Rangers instead of
taking more money from the
Yankees is the lack of a state
income tax in Texas,
according to Ken Rosenthal of
Fox Sports. New York
reportedly would've had to
offer a contract totaling around
$147 million just to match
Texas' offer at a post-tax
level."

In the newest issue of Inside ALEC, former OCPA
trustee Tom Coburn and current OCPA vice
president Jonathan Small say Oklahoma should not
go along with the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.
In the Journal Record, OCPA president Michael
Carnuccio points to the inconvenient truth that
Medicaid expansion actually increases emergencyroom usage.
A study ("Framing the Right Suspects: Measuring
Media Bias") by a Department of Justice economist
finds a media bias against conservative think tanks.

Hello, Katie.
Thank you for the kind words; happy to help General Pruitt and thankful for his
tremendous leadership!
Tomorrow is perfect for me, as I am pretty fluid aside from a 9:00-10:00am
appointment. Unfortunately, I am traveling on Wednesday. What is a good time
and location for the AG tomorrow? I'm cc'ing my colleague Cassandra, should
you need assistance on our end with scheduling details.
Thank you.
Best,

Freedom Flash: Tina on the Hobby Lobby Case, 49th may be OK, and more
01/20/2014 07:04 AM

OCPA's weekly e-mail delivering policy perspectives every Monday

NEWS & NOTES
OCPA president Michael Carnuccio notes that
Oklahoma government spending has reached a new
Feb-17-2017 006113

all-time high, while tax relief for Oklahoma families
has yet to materialize.

 
WHO'S COUNTING?
5,100
Approximate number of
employees by which the stategovernment workforce has
shrunk under Kansas Gov.
Sam Brownback in his first
three years in office, according
to David Freddoso, a journalist
who examined which of the
nation's freshman governors
have reduced the size of
government by shrinking their
states' bureaucracies.
Brownback leads the nation.

In the state's largest newspaper, OCPA research
associate Tina Dzurisin says attempts to eradicate
poverty through forcible wealth transfers have
missed the mark, and in this month's Perspective she
says the Hobby Lobby case teaches us that liberty is
tenable only with limited government.
Andrew Spiropoulos, who serves as the Milton
Friedman Distinguished Fellow at OCPA, lauds an
Oklahoma political leader with "the courage to take
on the vicious and powerful education
establishment."
OCPA senior vice president Brandon Dutcher finds
the "49th is not OK" argument unpersuasive, but
nevertheless proposes ideas for boosting per-pupil
spending. Mike Brake isn't convinced that per-pupil
spending matters.
Jayson Lusk, who serves as the Samuel Roberts
Noble Distinguished Fellow at OCPA, says
unmanned aerial vehicles ("drones") could benefit
Oklahoma farmers, ranchers, and energy producers.

WSJ:  Scott Pruitt:  ObamaCare's Next Legal Challenge

ObamaCare's Next Legal Challenge

The law says subsidies can only go through staterun exchanges.
By Scott Pruitt
Dec. 1, 2013 6:38 p.m. ET
Oklahoma City
As millions of Americans see their health-insurance premiums increase, have their coverage dropped as a
result of the Affordable Care Act, and are unable to use the federal exchange, Oklahoma has sued the
Obama administration. The Sooner State and several others are trying to stop the government from
imposing tax penalties on certain states, businesses and individuals in defiance of the law. If these legal
challenges are successful, the deficit spending associated with the new health-care law could be reduced
by approximately $700 billion over the next decade.
While the president's health law is vast and extraordinarily complex, it is in one respect very simple.
Subsidies are only to be made available, and tax penalties for not signing up for health insurance are only
to be assessed, in states that create their own health-care exchange. The IRS, however, is attempting to
enforce tax penalties in all states—including Oklahoma and the majority of the other states that have
declined to create their own exchanges. Citizens and businesses in these states must use the federal
exchange instead.

Bloomberg News
Feb-17-2017 006128

The distinction is critical, because under the terms of the law it is the availability of government
insurance-premium subsidies that triggers the penalties against businesses if they fail to provide their
employees with health insurance that the administration deems acceptable. This is a huge problem for
the administration, which desperately needs to hand out tax credits and subsidies to the citizenry to
quash the swelling backlash against the law.
When Oklahoma first raised this challenge in 2012, many experts predicted that the Sooner State would
"go it alone" in pursuing this legal strategy. Not so. In Indiana, the state and 15 school districts have filed
a lawsuit against the IRS, the agency that collects the penalties. Business owners (who, like the state of
Oklahoma, would be subject to penalties as employers) and individuals in Virginia and the District of
Columbia have done the same. In the D.C. lawsuit, the presiding judge recently rejected the Obama
administration's attempt to have the case dismissed, as the judge in the Oklahoma case did in August.
Motions for summary judgment will soon be filed in federal district courts, and our court system will
determine whether what the administration has called its "improvements" to the ACA—essentially by
ignoring some of its provisions—are lawful.
They are not. Congress was exceedingly clear that tax credits and subsidies are available to people
whose plans "were enrolled in through an exchange established by the State under section 1311 of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act." Even so, the administration argues that Congress intended
for all Americans to receive subsidies regardless of whether they enrolled in health-care coverage through
a state exchange or a federal exchange. But to arrive at that conclusion you have to ignore the plain
language of the law. And nowhere in the law did Congress authorize the IRS to provide the credits or
subsidies to those other than citizens who buy their insurance through an exchange established under
section 1311 of the ACA—i.e., a state exchange.
Congress specified that credits and subsidies are only to be available in states that set up their own
health-insurance exchange for a reason: It could not force states to set up exchanges. Instead, it had to
entice them to do so. Oklahoma's lawsuit is about preserving the state's authority to make a policy
decision granted to states under the Affordable Care Act. Our governor and policy makers in Oklahoma
decided it wasn't in the state's best interest to create a health-care exchange. The IRS, at the
administration's bidding, is attempting to take away the benefits of that choice by regulatory action. Such
attempts to expand the power of the executive branch should be troubling to all Americans.
While much time has been devoted in Washington to the issue of "defunding" the Affordable Care Act,
the success of these lawsuits would have much the same effect. Should the courts decide the IRS is
exceeding its authority and isn't allowed to assess the employer penalties in states that have not
established their own exchanges, the structure of the ACA will crumble—as one of the primary
mechanisms the federal government has employed to force people into the health-insurance market
evaporates.
As much as we wish the government were run like a business, the administration cannot "improve" upon
legislation passed by Congress by rolling out updates in the manner that Silicon Valley does. That's not
permitted under the Constitution: Congress passes laws, the president executes them. Period. That's why
Oklahoma and other states are fighting to stop the administration's attempt to "fix" the health-care law
through executive fiat.

Mr. Pruitt is the attorney general of Oklahoma.

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
 
As we recall the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, some of those on the left might be a bit uncomfortable with certain
aspects of JFK's legacy. Any fair examination of that legacy shows that he
was hardly the big-government liberal they prefer to recall. Indeed, as Ira
Stoll argues in his new book JFK, Conservative, Kennedy was devoted
chiefly to anticommunism and to economic growth. 
 
Kennedy was a stern anti-communist. And the most memorable phrase from
his inaugural address - "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what
you can do for your country" - could have served as a theme for
conservative welfare-reform policies of the 1990s. But he is best
remembered among advocates of smaller, leaner government for his 1963
proposal to cut individual and corporate income taxes - "the most important
step we could take to prevent a recession" he called it in the video posted
below, a "creative tax cut" that was specifically designed to increase
economic growth and create jobs.

The president's comments were not surprising: Oklahoma has a reputation
for leading the nation in early-childhood education. One prominent
Oklahoman, a key Obama fundraiser, has actually visited the White House
at least 16 times to discuss early-childhood education, and has appeared on
a platform with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to promote the cause.
 
But as I said at the time ("President Obama's enthusiasm for Oklahoma

for leading the nation in early-childhood education. One prominent
Oklahoman, a key Obama fundraiser, has actually visited the White House
at least 16 times to discuss early-childhood education, and has appeared on
a platform with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to promote the cause.
 
But as I said at the time ("President Obama's enthusiasm for Oklahoma
preschool not universally shared"), Mr. Obama's praise of Oklahoma's
preschool program was not warranted. And now comes more bad news for
preschool advocates.

The Oklahoma Water Resources Board recently ruled to restrict the property
rights of landowners in five southern Oklahoma counties by mandating a 10fold reduction in amount of water that can be withdrawn from the ArbuckleSimpson Groundwater Basin. The Board reduced the maximum annual yield
(the total amount of fresh groundwater that can be withdrawn while allowing
a minimum 20-year life of the basin) from 2 to 0.2 feet per acre of land
overlaying the basin per year. 
 
Groups such as the Oklahoma Farm Bureau (OKFB) are disappointed with
the ruling.

Over and over again, President Barack Obama said "if you like your health
plan, you will be able to keep your health plan." President Obama also
repeatedly said, "if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor." We are
now seeing those statements were lies, meant to deceive people into going
along with Obamacare. Nationwide, millions of people will eventually losethe
adequate health care plans they liked, and already thousands are losing
them here in Oklahoma. And this is only the beginning.
 
The Obama administration has already rejected Insure Oklahoma at least
once, and has forced less-than-desirable changes in order for Oklahoma to
gain a one-year extension of the program.

As you may know, next week is National School Choice Week, and Gov. Mary
Fallin has issued a proclamation declaring it to be School Choice Week in
Oklahoma, too. In observation of School Choice Week, OCPA is holding a press
conference on Tuesday, January 28, at 1:30 PM in the Blue Room of the state
Feb-17-2017 006175

capitol building to release our annual Oklahoma school-choice survey. This
public-opinion survey, conducted by Braun Research, Inc. and released by the
Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice and OCPA, finds strong support
among Oklahomans for charter schools, vouchers, tax credits, and education
savings accounts.
There are several chairs in the Blue Room, and there's plenty of standing room in
the back, so I urge you to join us at the press conference to show your support for
school choice. Hope to see you there!

Free Market Friday: Parents want to choose 

 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
  
 
At a state Capitol press conference last week, state Reps. Jason
Feb-17-2017 006177

Nelson, R-Oklahoma City, and Tom Newell, R-Seminole, rolled out legislation that
would create an education savings account program in Oklahoma. The time for this
idea has come.
 
In a public-opinion survey to be released on Tuesday by the Friedman Foundation
for Educational Choice (margin of error +/- 4.0 percentage points), registered
Oklahoma voters were asked: "An education savings account -- often called an
ESA -- allows parents to take their child out of a public district or charter school,
and receive a payment into a government-authorized savings account with
restricted but multiple uses. Parents can then use these funds to pay for private
school tuition, virtual education programs, private tutoring, or saving for future
college expenses. In general, do you favor or oppose this kind of savings account
system?"

Published each week, Free Market Friday is a syndicated column in The Journal Record written by

As Obamacare continues to crash and burn, many Americans are
discovering a central reason for this monumental train wreck: mandates.
 
The law essentially insists that everyone, everywhere, be covered for
everything, whether or not they need it or want it. Hence, we have 60-yearold men who had a vasectomy in 1980 covered for childbirth, and nondrinkers assured of alcoholism counseling. That's why new Obamacare
policies are so expensive, and millions are losing their old policies which
don't meet the "cover everything" mandates.

That's the question Jennifer Doverspike asks in an excellent new article over
at The Federalist ("The False Promise of Universal Pre-kindergarten").
 
Doverspike is the founder and editor of Six Forty Nine: Resource-Driven
Parenting and the co-founder of Midtown Tulsa Moms. A former intelligence
officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency with expertise in counterterrorism
and al-Qaida, she is a thorough researcher. When the evidence points to
benefits of early education, she acknowledges those benefits. But she has
no patience for the inflated claims of Barack Obama and others about the
effects of universal pre-kindergarten. "Preschool for disadvantaged children
may have its benefits," Doverspike writes, "but that does not augur for a
state-run program that catches all children."

Fallin on Obamacare: 'The

That's the question Jennifer Doverspike asks in an excellent new article over
at The Federalist ("The False Promise of Universal Pre-kindergarten").
 
Doverspike is the founder and editor of Six Forty Nine: Resource-Driven
Parenting and the co-founder of Midtown Tulsa Moms. A former intelligence
officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency with expertise in counterterrorism
and al-Qaida, she is a thorough researcher. When the evidence points to
benefits of early education, she acknowledges those benefits. But she has
no patience for the inflated claims of Barack Obama and others about the
effects of universal pre-kindergarten. "Preschool for disadvantaged children
may have its benefits," Doverspike writes, "but that does not augur for a
state-run program that catches all children."

Saving the GOP 
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
  
Political pundits and activists alike seem astounded by
carpetbagger Terry McAuliffe's victory in Virginia's high-profile
gubernatorial contest. They shouldn't be. Republicans have been put on notice -Feb-17-2017 006211

again.
What played out there was not unlike what converted Colorado from a sold red
state to the not-so-battleground territory Democrats now enjoy. Just as Colorado's
demographics have transformed from an influx of Californians, northern Virginia
has changed the lead of Southern states. In fact, it's a textbook example of how
growing government not only violates Republican ideals, it undercuts the GOP's
future. The progression in northern Virginia is due in no small part to the swelling
federal government, with bureaucrats, activists and consultants beholden to Uncle
Sam. The northern portion of Virginia is blue and growing.
