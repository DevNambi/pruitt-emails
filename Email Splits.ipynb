Could you please get back to me by Tuesday, April 9 if you want to sign on. I hope to get the letter to the Hill on April 10.  Feb-17-2017 001648  Your name will be listed with your state and years in office so please send the years! Thanks I have been working with Grant, Terry and Mark for the past several years in encouraging Congress to act. Those in the know believe that the law enforcement perspective provided both through a former AG letter, as well as the one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will make a difference. Please feel free to call one of us if you want to talk further about this. I also attach below former AG Bob Stephan's comments this week at a Kansas City roundtable coordinated by the National Immigration Forum. There are likely to be lots of grass roots opportunities to speak on this topic in the next few months so please let me know if you would like to become more involved. By the way, Mark Shurtleff is on the Forum Board of Directors. Grant and Terry have also been very active in speaking out on immigration issues. Thanks so much for your consideration Lynne phone 703 220 5544 email Toswim2@yahoo.com  Feb-17-2017 001649  \""

I have come to dislike the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon sense.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Contrary to my hopefully informed\\nintuition as to consequences, almost everything President Obama proposes these days is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon sense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, eg., \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon sense health coverage, common sense immigration\\nreform, you name it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0 Indeed, the phrase is being utilized so often so as to become trite;\\none should also keep in mind that Webster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, among other meanings of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,\\ndefines the term as conveying \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecond rate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d What is needed in the immigration debate\\nis \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuncommon sense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a commodity currently in very short supply in Washington. I\\nwould rename your e-mail as stated above.\\n2. \\xc2\\xa0Throughout the letter you use the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cundocumented\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. I understand the Liberal\\nurge to use a euphemism, but I have always thought it better to call a spade a spade. In\\nthis instance the semantically accurate term is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cillegal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The overwhelming majority of\\nthe 11 million \\xe2\\x80\\x9cillegals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in this country are not victims of administrative error on the part\\nof ICE or some other agency. Nor are they individuals who have simply lost their papers.\\nInstead they are persons who, with their families, have deliberately violated American\\nlaw. I would insert \\xe2\\x80\\x9cillegal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wherever \\xe2\\x80\\x9cundocumented\\xe2\\x80\\x9d appears in your e-mail.\\n3. a. I realize that we AG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and former AG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like to refer to ourselves as being or having\\nbeen the chief \\xe2\\x80\\x9claw enforcement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d officers in our States. This sounds good on the\\ncampaign trail but, except in a few instances, is simply not true. As a general proposition\\n(no pun intended), we should resist this temptation and instead refer to AG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generically\\nFeb-17-2017 001635\\n\\n\\x0c(again no pun intended) as the chief \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d officers of their respective jurisdictions.\\nb. To avoid the inference that, despite prior affirmations, we are really\\xc2\\xa0 much more\\nconcerned with \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomprehensive immigration reform\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincreased border security\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, I\\nsuggest the following rewrite of your last two sentences:\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPut simply, practical reform to our federal immigration laws which addresses both\\nissues will make us all safer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe urge you to move expeditiously with consideration and action on such reform\\nlegislation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xc2\\xa0 Please do not take these observations as critical of your enterprise. If the foregoing changes\\nwere made I would sign your letter, but I realize that this is probably not feasible. Since, as you\\nknow, Spring has come to Washington, I will begin a search for a blooming of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuncommon\\nsense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and will alert you should I discern any such exotic flower.
