Capitol Beat Story  Melissa, I wanted to check with you on a statement in the story below. Ihighlighted a sentence near the end that is partially a Pruitt quote but alsomentions regional haze. Has AG Pruitt characterized regional haze along
with “sue and settle” as this sentence implies?

 Patrick B. McGuigan Published: 29-Jul-2013 
 OKLAHOMA CITY – Despite an adverse circuit court ruling rebuffing the state of Oklahoma’s legalchallenge to an Environmental Protection Agency (APA) edict, a citizen activist group is continuing to fightthe controversial regional haze standard that could require Oklahoma power plants to switch fuels tooffset sulfur dioxide emissions. 
Feb-17-2017 004014
Federal pressure on power generation in Oklahoma could have real-world implications, including a
minimum 11-12 percent rate hike for residential consumers. While several state officials have opposedthe EPA maneuvers, some state officials have recently been quiet, and a key state utility firm has agreedto changes that will hike utility rates. 
 EPA critics have assailed underlying authority for the regulatory provision, which is based on a 1977amendment to the federal Clean Air Act. They decry it as “an aesthetic visibility standard” designed toreduce haze on government lands, with little gain for air quality. 
 Further, Americans for Prosperity-Oklahoma, says the projected double-digit rate hikes, if the EPA getsits way, will actually be closer to 20 percent – an average of $200 in increased costs for the typical statefamily. 
 Matt Ball, state director for AFP-OK, said, “At a time when Oklahomans overwhelmingly agree thatelectricity rates are already too high, why should state policymakers support a settlement agreement withthe Obama EPA and other liberal environmental groups like the Sierra Club that will raise rates on PSO[Public Service Company of Oklahoma] customers up to $200 more per year and pave the way for ratesto be raised on all Oklahomans?” 
 Ball continued, “President Obama has made clear his intentions on power plant regulation and this oneEPA regulation, by mandating fuel-switching, will effectively mandate how much Oklahomans will pay forelectricity.” 
 Last weekend, Ball told CapitolBeatOK the petition already had triggered 3,078 Oklahomans to contactstate officials via the petition letters. 
 Ball said, “While the heavy-handed approach of President Obama’s EPA is likely to result in utility ratehikes on Oklahoma families and businesses, what is more troubling is that state policymakers mightconsider supporting it. This plan hurts Oklahomans’ pocketbooks and makes our state less competitivefor jobs. AFP-OK is circulating this petition so that state policymakers are made aware of howOklahomans feel about this important pocketbook issue.” 
 In the first of a series of emails to AFP supporters and other free market advocates in the state, Ballassailed the EPA benchmark as operating “under the guise of pseudo-science.” 
 Commissioner of Labor Mark Costello told CapitolBeatOK, “Should this EPA mandated policy beimplemented in our state, I have serious concerns about the negative impact on Oklahoma's wageearners.” He asserted, “There is no urgent need for the state of Oklahoma to rush into embracing a policybased solely on EPA demands. This issue needs to be fully 'vetted' by the Oklahoma CorporationCommission.” 
 That three-member commission is the constitutional state agency that regulates many businesses,including all utility companies. 
Costello and other critics 
of the haze mandate say 
it could erode two of Oklahoma’s key economic
advantages
 – comparatively robust employment (a 5 percent jobless rate, among the nation’s lowest) andlow cost of doing business, not to mention wage improvements over several years 
 The Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers (OIEC) and the state Energy Coalition have faced off withstate members of 
the Sierra Club, who back the haze rule
. 
 Frustrating advocates of energy independence, the EPA applied the regional haze standard to theWichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge near Lawton, in southwestern Oklahoma. EPA has pressuredfor fuel switching (from “clean coal” to natural gas) at power plants more than 250 miles away, in the farnortheast corner of the Sooner State. 
Feb-17-2017 004015
The situation has provoked unusual division among utility firms. While Public Service Company ofOklahoma (PSO) is willing to settle with EPA, the Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) has fought theissue in court. 
 Last Friday (July 26), 
a divided Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel rejected Oklahoma’s April 2012
petition
 to rebuff the EPA’s haze rule, 
issued in December 2011. 
 Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt assailed the Tenth Circuit decision, saying, “We disagree and aredisappointed with the panel’s 2-1 decision. We will continue to fight to preserve the ability of Oklahomastakeholders to create an Oklahoma solution and to protect Oklahoma consumers from excessive andunnecessary utility costs. We are reviewing the decision and considering our options.” 
 U.S. Rep. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma City, said he was “frustrated” with the circuit court ruling, whichhe characterizes as “needless and excessive.” Unless the ruling is tempered upon further review, “It isnow certain that Oklahoma utility customers will face a new rate hike without any health or economicbenefit.” 
 In addition to fighting the circuit ruling, Pruitt is part of a coalition of state attorneys general seeking tounderstand the EPA’s alleged “sue and settle” strategy. A federal lawsuit against EPA, filed inOklahoma’s western district, seeks disclosure of EPA tactics benefiting environmental groups likeGreenpeace, Defenders of Wildlife, Wildearth Guardians and the Sierra Club. 
 Pruitt characterizes “sue-and-settle” and the regional haze controversy as part of a “blatant strategy bythe EPA to go around the process and bend the rules to create environmental regulations that have failedin Congress.” In a total of 45 settlements already made public, EPA has paid out nearly $1 million inattorneys’ fees to environmental groups, Pruitt and the other state AGs assert. 
 Earlier this year, the states of Oklahoma, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, NorthDakota, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyoming submitted to EPA a federal open records requestfocused on the “sue-and-settle” strategy.

Re: AFP town hall So would the AG be opposed to anyone in the town hall/panel discussion 
Feb-17-2017 004273
discussing PSO settlement?  I would be looking to him for the messaging
points that you mention below. 
Heavy hand of federal govt infringing on
 states rights by mandating how much Oklahomans pay for electricity.
Frankly, our messaging has been mostly identical. 
But our petition letter
 is aimed at the settlement agreement bc we believe it paves the way for rate increases on all. Frankly, I just assume the AG and Lankford talk sue and settle, how the EPA is deploying these tactics and what their respective offices have done on oversight and litigation, and let Yeatman from CEI give an objective 
analysis of costs to ratepayers 
from revised state implementation plan on
regional haze (which includes the PSO rate increase). 
That way you guys
 dont have to deliver those messages and can focus on what the AG does best, opposing the Obama administration and its nasty tactics on the environment. 
Would you guys be opposed to that?

Please see the attached, proposed joint-release to go today,
if possible.
I would suggest the joint release from both offices and AFPF to go sometime today, probably in the early afternoon to afford time for approval from your respective offices.Once the release goes out, would you all be able to post on social media and send to your respective email lists? We will do the same.
I believe a joint release would maximize the effectiveness and help to drive the crowd, coming from both offices and AFPF.
Thoughts on that? Please let us know let us know if you have any edits or any questions.
Thanks!

Subject:"EPA Regulation and Your Pocketbook" - Thursday, Aug 22nd 10-11:30amDate:08/14/2013 03:57 PMImportance:HighAaron and Todd:Firstly, thank you to your respective bosses and all they are doing to push back against President Obama's 
EPA and its axis 
with liberal environmental groups to increase energy costs for Oklahomans and American
families across the states. 
You both work for true champions of freedom and liberty!
I wanted to send a brief rundown of the format for next Thursday's AFP Foundation-OK Community Forum: 
"EPA Regulations and Your Pocketbook." 
I have copied John Tidwell and Josh Harlow w/ Jones PR in OKC
 since they contract with us for PR in multiple mediums.WHEN: August 22nd 10am-11:30am
WHAT: “EPA Regulations and Your Pocketbook” - Panel Discussion and Q&A
WHO: Congressman James Lankford
 OK Attorney General Scott Pruitt
William Yeatman, Asst Director of the Center for Energy & Environment
at the Competitive
 Enterprise Institute (CEI).
 WHERE: Oklahoma City University Meinders School of Business
 2501 N. Blackwelder Ave (corner of 24
th and McKinley)
 OKC, OK 73106
FORMAT / CONTENTThis is an AFP Foundation-OK event (501c3) so there will not be any calls to action of any sort and will strictly be an issue education event for your constituents to come and learn about the great work your bosses are doing to push back against the EPA in Congress and in court and 
how these overly
aggressive
tactics and regulation will hurt the pocketbooks of Oklahomans.
The top-down, overly burdensome regulatory takeovers from the Obama EPA truly do
threaten
Oklahoma families and businesses by pursuing an ideological agenda that results in
 increases in utility rates and cost of doing business.My goal is for this to not only be an event that helps AFP/AFPF-OK but one that helps the Congressman and the AG both from a PR and policy perspective.
CONGRESSMAN LANKFORD
Feb-17-2017 004302
The Congressman can discuss his bill on Sue and Settle, his EPA committee business on House Govt
Oversight. 
The idea is to discuss how Sue and Settle works to execute the President's
ideological environmental agenda by circumventing Congressional
authority. 
Also, perhaps
discuss all that the
Congressman
has done on Regional Haze within the
SUe and Settle context
—strictly aesthetic regulation et al. 
If he wants to discuss the situation that RH regulations has
 put OK utilities into he is certainly welcome to do that as well with out specific discussion of the PSO/EPA settlement.
ACTION ITEMS
-If you can provide some info (talking points, bullet points, et al) re: Lankford's Sue and Settle bill and additional items he would like to discuss within the vein above, we can put those talkers into a few power point slides and handouts for each attendee.ATTORNEY GENERAL PRUITTThis is an excellent opportunity for the AG to discuss the role of attorneys general as a last line of defense for states rights against overly intrusive federal regulation of which EPA environmental is only one example.
More specifically, the AG can discuss the specifics of his new Sue and Settle litigation, its merits, context, etc so as to explain how the states are pushing back against the President's environmental agenda through the 
rule of law. 
If the AG would like to discuss his involvement in seeking dismissal of the PSO Environmental
Compliance case at the OCC, he is certainly more than welcome to do so. 
I understand if he does not wish
 to.
ACTION ITEMS
-Please provide some talking points, bullet points et al. re Pruitt's Sue and Settle litigation, its importance 
and any other point the AG would like to discuss within the vein above. 
We will put into PPT slides and
 handouts for all attendees.WILL YEATMAN (CEI)Yeatman is with the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) in DC and is the Asst Director of CEIs Center for 
Energy and Environment.
Yeatman was retained several months ago by AFP Foundation-OK to perform a
study of the manner EPA has conducted itself in the states, including Oklahoma. 
This study will include a
 comprehensive cost analysis of the Revised State Implementation Plan (SIP) on Regional Haze compliance.
This will include analysis of the costs of the EPA/PSO settlement and projected costs to ratepayers.
Yeatman will present the study in a brief PPT presentation at the event after each of you have had the 
opportunity to speak. 
I will provide both of your offices an advance copy of the study. 
The idea here is for
 an objective third party think tank fellow to discuss PSO/EPA settlement and you will not be asked to comment specifically.Q&A
The panel discussion will be followed by Q&A from the attendees. 
Again, the session is scheduled to run
 from 10am-11:30am total.
Feb-17-2017 004303
MEDIAWe will have media in attendance and, if each of your offices is comfortable, we would like to tape the panel session and edit for YouTube to disseminate to our membership who are unable to attend the event.
If this is a problem please let myself or John Tidwell know.Thanks for all you guys do,Matt BallState DirectorAFP Foundation/Americans for Prosperity-Oklahoma(405) 315-3668 mobileMball@afphq.org

Subject:Bullet points from AG PruittDate:08/21/2013 11:07 AM
Here are some bullet points from the AG's office on "sue and settle." 
Let me know if you have questions,
AC. 12 states - led by Oklahoma - seeking documents from the EPA under theFreedom of Information Act related to “sue and settle.” The tactic is employed by the EPA as a way to settle lawsuits withenvironmental organizations, including Greenpeace, Defenders of Wildlife,WildEarth Guardians and the Sierra Club, without allowing stateinvolvement. In some instances, the EPA entered a consent decree the same day alawsuit was filed by the special interest group, suggesting prior knowledge.The agreements between the EPA and environmental groups have led tonew rules and regulations for states without allowing attorneys general toenter the process to defend the interest of states, businesses andconsumers. Out of the 45 settlements made public, the EPA has paid nearly $1 millionin attorneys’ fees to the environmental groups, while also committing todevelop sweeping new regulations. One EPA consent decree led to theEPA’s costliest regulation ever – the Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS). Under the Clean Air Act, the states – not the EPA – design and implementplans for compliance with the Regional Haze program. States’ alsorequested a fee waiver. CEI found that 92 percent of the time EPA grants fee waiver requests fromnoncommercial requesters who are supportive of EPA’s policies andagendas, but denies a majority of fee waiver requests from noncommercialrequesters who are critical of EPA.

Oklahoma Attorney General Wins First Battle in Challenge to Implementationof Obamacare OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt Monday won the state’s firstchallenge against the Affordable Care Act after a federal judge denied the government’smotion to dismiss the case. Judge Ronald White issued the decision Monday afternoon in the U.S. District Court for theEastern District of Oklahoma in Muskogee. “The court rejected the federal government’s argument that Oklahoma lacked standing tochallenge the law, allowing us to proceed with this pivotal case,” General Pruitt said. “We’reoptimistic the court will recognize what states have known for months that the IRSdisregarded the law by making the large employer mandate effective in Oklahoma or in any ofthe 33 other states without a state health care exchange.” Oklahoma challenged implementation of the Affordable Care Act after the IRS finalized a rulethat would allow the federal government to punish “large employers,” including localgovernment, with millions of dollars in tax penalties in states without state health careexchanges, which is not allowed under the health care law. “Congress provided a choice for Oklahoma and other states in implementation of the healthcare law, and the IRS is attempting to take that away by rule,” General Pruitt said. “Theadministration miscalculated how many states would support this law, so now they’re usingthe IRS to push through provisions that Congress did not pass.” Oklahoma’s original lawsuit was filed in January 2011. In September, following the U.S.Supreme Court decision, General Pruitt filed an amended complaint to raise issues related tothe law’s implementation. ###

Subject:Summary: Oklahoma Medicaid expansion voter surveyDate:08/29/2013 04:13 PMRecently, OCPA hosted a series of conference calls that served as an overview of public opinion datafrom a recent survey of 865 likely Oklahoma voters. The subject of the survey was the ObamacareMedicaid expansion, which Gov. Fallin has prudently rejected for Oklahoma, but which some groupsare still pushing for.
Below please find a summary of the key findings from the survey and links to download PDFs of thefull survey data. Please let us know if OCPA can provide follow-up info on this or any other aspect ofthe Obamacare Medicaid expansion debate.

Oklahoma voters show wariness of Obamacare
Medicaid expansion
BY OCPA
·
THU, AUG 15, 2013 07:00 AM CDT
OKLAHOMA
AND
MEDICAID
Feb-17-2017 004349
With the Obamacare Medicaid expansion currently a hot topic of conversation, thenonpartisan
Liberty Foundation of America
has commissioned broad surveys in a number of states togauge voter opinion on the subject,
including one in Oklahoma this past May
. That survey polled865 likely general election voters and had a margin of error at +/- 3.33 percent.
The resulting data provide insight into the Oklahoma electorate’s views on the expansion ofMedicaid as allowed in the federal Obamacare law. When considering these results, it is worthnoting that Oklahoma has seen every county vote for the Republican nominee in each of the pastthree presidential election cycles. Also, every statewide elected office is now held by a Republican,and both houses of the state Legislature feature super-majority Republican control.Some highlights from the survey:(1) The partisan split between Republicans and Democrats is enormous on Medicaid expansion, withRepublican voters strongly opposed to the expansion and Democrats in favor. Independent voters aresomewhat split on this issue.(2) Among all voters (AAV), 52 percent think it is time to give some new candidates a chance inoffice in the upcoming 2014 election cycle.(3) AAV, a plurality of voters (47 percent) believe that Medicaid is a “flawed program that wastes alot of money, has problems of fraud and abuse, and is in severe need of reform.” As noted below,this is a strong argument in the minds of Oklahoma voters against expansion of Medicaid. In thecross-tabulations (Table 4-1), 67.4 percent of Republicans hold this belief along with 45.2 percent ofIndependents.(4) AAV, Medicaid expansion is opposed by a 46.2 percent to 41.9 percent plurality. In the cross-tabulations (Table 5-1), 66.2 percent of Republicans hold this belief along with 45.2 percent ofIndependents.(5) When the wide variance in the estimated number of Medicaid enrollees (and associated taxpayercosts) as a result of expansion is considered, a near-majority of voters oppose Medicaid expansion at
Feb-17-2017 004350
49 percent. In the cross-tabulations (Table 6-1), 69.4 percent of Republicans hold this view along
with 41 percent of Independents. Again, as noted below, this is another strong argument in the mindsof many voters against expansion. The Ohio Speaker of the House specifically cited this variance asthe reason the Ohio House of Representatives rejected Medicaid expansion.(6) Regarding the seven messaging questions tested, top pollsters will tell you that any percentageabove 40 percent who find an argument "very compelling" is the gold standard because when"somewhat compelling" voters are added, you easily surpass the 50 percent threshold. AAV, fivearguments against Medicaid expansion polled very strongly. Namely, more than 40 percent AAVfound these arguments “very compelling”:·
54%: Medicaid should not be expanded until the waste, fraud, and abuse in the program is
cleaned up; 
·
49%: Because there is so much disagreement among experts on the costs of expandingMedicaid, we shouldn’t rush into any expansion until we have a better handle on thefinancial consequences;·
44%: We can’t count on the debt-ridden federal government’s contribution to OklahomaMedicaid to last forever, so in the future Oklahoma taxpayers will be left to foot the bill forall the new Medicaid recipients added;·
42%: Expanding Medicaid would allow too many able-bodied young people to getinsurance, even if they just choose not to work to provide for their own healthcare needs;and·
41%: Expanding Medicaid would just give the federal government more power and control
over our lives.
With that same set of questions, the cross-tabulation findings are the key to interpreting the surveyresults. Of the seven arguments, two polled very high among Republican voters and Independentvoters, with another two arguments grabbing a solid group of Independent voters. The specific
findings are in Tables 7-1, 8-1, 9-1, 10-1, 11-1, 12-1, and 13-1. 
(Click on chart to enlarge)Policymakers across the country in states like Ohio, Florida, South Carolina, and elsewhere arereceiving strong pushback from their Republican voting bases when the issue of Obamacare’sMedicaid expansion is considered. 
The results of the Liberty Foundation survey suggest the same
dynamic likely exists in Oklahoma
.
Legislators and statewide elected officials are finding that
when they hold an open and honest
Feb-17-2017 004351
conversation with their constituents about the many factors involved with Obamacare’s expansion of
Medicaid, their constituents are often opposed to expansion
. In Oklahoma, the survey data suggestthat the voting base of Republican elected officials is unequivocally against expansion, andunaffiliated voters break toward rejecting expansion when details are provided.

slide presentation
and the
cross-tabulations
from the
Magellan Strategies survey.

RE: VIDEO for SPN Oklahoma "Big Ideas" nightHi Diane,
 We can definitely record at the AG’s office. The actual filming with Gen. Pruitt shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.I will probably come early to set up. As you can see from the draft below, each appearance is pretty short. We wouldlike him to say something along the lines of “I fight for federalism because I believe in big ideas.” But we welcomefeedback from your team…would you like to tweak the sentence or add to it? The idea is that each personcommunicates one big idea that elevates our state.
 As for scheduling, we are trying to have all pieces recorded by August 15th.
 Thanks for your help!

 Hi Dacia,
We are working with General's Pruitt's executive assistant to schedule the video tapping for the Big Ideasvideo. How long will General Pruitt's segment be and how long do you think we need to record?
Also, it lists his location as the Capitol, but I think General Pruitt would rather do it here at the AG's Office-- 313 NE 21 (just SW of the Capitol).

RE: VIDEO for SPN Oklahoma "Big Ideas" night
Hi Diane,
We can definitely record at the AG’s office. The actual filming with Gen. Pruitt shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.I will probably come early to set up. As you can see from the draft below, each appearance is pretty short. We wouldlike him to say something along the lines of “I fight for federalism because I believe in big ideas.” But we welcomefeedback from your team…would you like to tweak the sentence or add to it? The idea is that each personcommunicates one big idea that elevates our state.
As for scheduling, we are trying to have all pieces recorded by August 15th.
Thanks for your help!

Hi Dacia,
We are working with General's Pruitt's executive assistant to schedule the video tapping for the Big Ideasvideo. How long will General Pruitt's segment be and how long do you think we need to record?
Also, it lists his location as the Capitol, but I think General Pruitt would rather do it here at the AG's Office-- 313 NE 21 (just SW of the Capitol).

We can definitely record at the AG’s office. The actual filming with Gen. Pruitt shouldn’t take morethan 30 minutes. I will probably come early to set up. As you can see from the draft below, eachappearance is pretty short. We would like him to say something along the lines of “I fight forfederalism because I believe in big ideas.” But we welcome feedback from your team…would you like to tweak thesentence or add to it? The idea is that each person communicates one big idea that elevates our state.
As for scheduling, we are trying to have all pieces recorded by August 15th.
Thanks for your help!

We are working with General's Pruitt's executive assistant to schedule the video tapping for the Big Ideasvideo. How long will General Pruitt's segment be and how long do you think we need to record?
Also, it lists his location as the Capitol, but I think General Pruitt would rather do it here at the AG's Office-- 313 NE 21 (just SW of the Capitol).

Subject:Re: Oct. 3 School Choice CoalitionDate:09/30/2013 04:21 PMThanks Baxter. Appreciate the invite!
Mr Price, unfortunately I was unable to move my flight to Asheville, NC on Thursday, but would love to come back at some later date and present our findings to the Coalition. My time in other states developing model legislation and conducting state assessments is at the core of what I do in this new position.
Please keep me informed on where Oklahoma is heading on parental choice. It IS for the kids!StuartStuart JollyExecutive Political DirectorEducation Freedom Alliance405.514.0514S.jolly@EduFreedom.orgFrom: Baxter Lewallen <

Gridlock is not an American
problem. It is an American
achievement'
Forward the cause:
The U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down a part of the federal Defenseof Marriage Act (DOMA) that made it illegal for the federal government totreat marriage solely as the union of one man and one woman - legallyreferred to as Part 3 of DOMA. The Court's ruling, however, left firmly inplace Part 2 of DOMA which says that the states are the final arbiter of howmarriage is treated. The ruling did not implement so-called same-sexmarriage (SSM) in 35 states where it is banned by statute or constitutionalprovision.
Despite the narrow ruling from the Supreme Court, President Obama isdetermined to undermine these 35 states through the use of federalexecutive power. President Obama bluntly stated that "It's my personalbelief - but I'm speaking now as a president as opposed to as a lawyer - thatif you've married in Massachusetts and you move someplace else, you'restill married, and that under federal law you should be able to obtain thebenefits of any lawfully married couple."

put it,"Obamacare is bad for the country. We would like to see it repealed andreplaced, not to score political points, but to save our nation's health carefrom higher costs and lesser care.

The current shutdown serves as one more reminder that Oklahoma House

wise
to try to plan for scenarios in which state
agencies lose federal funding. Unfortunately, Speaker Shannon's effortswere not successful. Now our state government is put in the position of

"There's a tradition in education," former New York City schools chancellorFrank Macchiarola once observed, "that if you spend a dollar and it doesn'twork, you should spend two dollars; and not only that, you should give thosetwo dollars to the same person who couldn't do the job with only one."
That tradition is alive and well in Oklahoma. Earlier this year the
TulsaWorld
reported
that national education activist Jonah Edelman, founder and
chief executive officer of Stand for Children, was in Tulsa to announce thathis organization is launching an affiliate in Oklahoma. "If Oklahoma wants toget results for students, it needs to fund the reforms it has already passed,"Edelman said. One example he cited was a recent reform of the ReadingSufficiency Act.

Loretta Bass of the University of Oklahoma and Nicole Warehime ofOklahoma Baptist University examined data of the Fragile Families andChild Well-being Study, measuring the relationship between familystructure and child health outcomes at age 5. The researchers lookedat data - collected for children born to 1,186 married mothers and3,712 unmarried mothers between 1988 and 2000 - to explore theeffects of parental marital status on three measures: the child's healthinsurance type, the child's having a routine medical doctor, and thechild's being reported in excellent health.

It seems almost weekly that we hear about more intrusion by federalgovernment agencies, such as the NSA, into the lives of citizens who are
supposed to be free. When the government secretly
invades the privacy oflaw-abiding citizens
, attempts to
intimidate the assembling of organizationslike OCPA and ALEC
, and uses the IRS to target those who
don't agree
with
President Barack Obama, reflection upon the words of 
the founding fathers
is imperative.
Thomas Jefferson said: "My reading of history convinces me that most badgovernment results from too much government."Jefferson provided thisvision for the proper role of government: "A wise and frugal Governmentshall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise freeto regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall nottake from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum ofgood government."

By OCPA

Oklahoma
Parental choice preferable
to increased government
spending
Forward the cause:
Former OCPA trustee Dr. Tom Coburn and current OCPA fiscal policydirector Jonathan Small have been two of the leading voices in Oklahomawarning against the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. In a column published
yesterday in the
Tulsa World, they make the argument that policymakersshould continue to oppose expanding Medicaid - in any form.
"The lessons of history and the hard numbers are clear: It is not fiscallyresponsible or wise to expand a strained entitlement program and rely onfederal funding that is unlikely," Coburn and Small write. "While it has beentempting for some consultants and lawmakers to try to dress up Medicaidexpansion as 'program redesign,' it is simply not in our state's long-terminterest to expand Medicaid, whether that's under the guise of additional
federal funding or creative program designs.
Given the economic facts, any
expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would be a step in thewrong direction."

RE: VIDEO for SPN Oklahoma "Big Ideas" night Hi Diane, 
 We can definitely record at the AG’s office. The actual filming with Gen. Pruitt shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.I will probably come early to set up. As you can see from the draft below, each appearance is pretty short. We wouldlike him to say something along the lines of “I fight for federalism because I believe in big ideas.” But we welcomefeedback from your team…would you like to tweak the sentence or add to it? The idea is that each personcommunicates one big idea that elevates our state. 
 As for scheduling, we are trying to have all pieces recorded by August 15th. 
 Thanks for your help!

We are working with General's Pruitt's executive assistant to schedule the video tapping for the Big Ideasvideo. How long will General Pruitt's segment be and how long do you think we need to record?
Also, it lists his location as the Capitol, but I think General Pruitt would rather do it here at the AG's Office-- 313 NE 21 (just SW of the Capitol).

dinner this year) recently
reminded
Oklahoma policymakers how important it

Dear Mr. President:
As the temporary slowdown in government operations enters itssecond week, I write to explain why conservatives have insisted onmaking the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act the primesource of contention. Speaking for our organization, I can tell you we'rein this fight because of the harm the law is inflicting on Americansacross the country.

Subject:Greetings from the Attorney General's OfficeDate:07/16/2013 11:32 AM
Greetings all. 
I hope this message finds you doing well. 
I'm writing to let you know about a couple of
items. 
First, as you can tell by this e-mail message, I am now with the AG's office. 
This week I began my new
job as director of public affairs at the attorney general's office. 
The governor and her staff were gracious
in wishing me well in this new endeavor; meanwhile, the AG and his staff have been great in welcoming
me to the team. 
In addition to press-related duties, I'll be working on community relations, public affairs
outreach and strategic communications strategy. 
I'm looking forward to this new opportunity.
Hopefully, we can find ways for OCPA and the AG's office to work together. 
Which brings me to the next
item of business. 
I wanted to bring to your attention a great piece from Fred Barnes in 
The WeeklyStandard, about the efforts of AG Pruitt and other Republican AG's to challenge the Obama
administration agenda. 
You can find the article here:

 Here's a clip: Practically no one has noticed the emergence of the Republican AGs. Yet they’re ascourge of President Obama. They drive the Environmental Protection Agency crazy.They’ve beaten the best lawyers at the Justice Department numerous times. “What Ireally do for fun is I go into the office [and] I sue the Obama administration,” Texasattorney general Greg Abbott said last year. He’s filed 30 lawsuits against theadministration, 17 against EPA alone—with considerable success.The AGs, who often attack the administration in packs, have done more thanRepublicans in Congress, statehouses, or anywhere else to block, cripple, undermine,or weaken Obama’s initiatives. They failed to stop Obamacare in the Supreme Court,but won limits on Medicaid and neutralized the use of the commerce clause toexpand the reach of the federal government. And there’s one case left. AG ScottPruitt of Oklahoma has sued to prevent Obama-run health insurance exchanges fromhanding out subsidies. If he wins—and he has a credible case—the implementation ofObamacare will come to a halt, at least temporarily. ...Scott Pruitt, 45, was a state senator and co-owner of the Oklahoma RedHawks Triple-A baseball team before his election as AG. He took the lead in suing the federalgovernment over the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill on the ground that itjeopardizes state pension funds. Ten AGs have joined the suit. He and Abbottsucceeded in voiding a dubious EPA rule that claimed air pollution from Texas andOklahoma was harming Granite City, Illinois.Pruitt never refers to the Affordable Care Act as Obamacare because he doesn’t wantto “politicize” an issue that, for him, is about the rule of law and the federalgovernment’s exceeding its authority. But he takes a sharply critical view of Obama.“He’s kept his promise that Washington knows best,” Pruitt says. “He’s kept hispromise that if Congress doesn’t [act], he can’t wait.

Here's a clip:
Practically
no
one
has
noticed
the
emergence
of
the
Republican
AGs.
Yet
they’re
a
scourge
of
President
Obama.
They
drive
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
crazy.
They’ve
beaten
the
best
lawyers
at
the
Justice
Department
numerous
times.
“What
I
really
do
for
fun
is
I
go
into
the
office
[and]
I
sue
the
Obama
administration,”
Texas
attorney
general
Greg
Abbott
said
last
year.
He’s
filed
30
lawsuits
against
the
administration,
17
against
EPA
alone—with
considerable
success.
The
AGs,
who
often
attack
the
administration
in
packs,
have
done
more
than
Republicans
in
Congress,
statehouses,
or
anywhere
else
to
block,
cripple,
undermine,
or
weaken
Obama’s
initiatives.
They
failed
to
stop
Obamacare
in
the
Supreme
Court,
but
won
limits
on
Medicaid
Feb-17-2017 004505
and neutralized the use of the commerce clause to expand the reach of the federal government.
And
there’s
one
case
left.
AG
Scott
Pruitt
of
Oklahoma
has
sued
to
prevent
Obama-run
health
insurance
exchanges
from
handing
out
subsidies.
If
he
wins—and
he
has
a
credible
case—the
implementation
of
Obamacare
will
come
to
a
halt,
at
least
temporarily.
...
Scott
Pruitt,
45,
was
a
state
senator
and
co-owner
of
the
Oklahoma
RedHawks
Triple-A
baseball
team
before
his
election
as
AG.
He
took
the
lead
in
suing
the
federal
government
over
the
Dodd-Frank
financial
reform
bill
on
the
ground
that
it
jeopardizes
state
pension
funds.
Ten
AGs
have
joined
the
suit.
He
and
Abbott
succeeded
in
voiding
a
dubious
EPA
rule
that
claimed
air
pollution
from
Texas
and
Oklahoma
was
harming
Granite
City,
Illinois.
Pruitt
never
refers
to
the
Affordable
Care
Act
as
Obamacare
because
he
doesn’t
want
to
“politicize”
an
issue
that,
for
him,
is
about
the
rule
of
law
and
the
federal
government’s
exceeding
its
authority.
But
he
takes
a
sharply
critical
view
of
Obama.
“He’s
kept
his
promise
that
Washington
knows
best,”
Pruitt
says.
“He’s
kept
his
promise
that
if
Congress
doesn’t
[act],
he
can’t
wait.
The
only
thing
wrong
with
that
is
it’s
not
consistent
with
our
Constitution
and
our
rule
of
law.
He
can’t
do
that.
Who
else
but
a
state
attorney
general
is
in
a
position
to
respond?
Who
else
is
there
but
a
state
AG
to
stand
up
and
say
no?”
Pruitt
likes
his
job.
He
is
the
chairman
of
the
Republican
Attorneys
General
Association.
It's a great story and one I thought OCPA would possibly want to share via blog, social media or otheravenues of communication.

Wall Street Journal: Using 'Sue and Settle' to Thwart Oil and Gas Drillers
In Case You Missed It
Using 'Sue and Settle' to Thwart Oiland Gas Drillers The Endangered Species Act is being employedmore than ever to block development. By 
STEPHEN MOORE
Oklahoma City Last week the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and an environmentaladvocacy group agreed to a legal settlement that will place nine species—includingthe Panama City crayfish, moccasinshell mussel and boreal toad—on the fast track forplacement on the endangered species list. It is only the latest of many such listings.The Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned Fish and Wildlife to designate some
Feb-17-2017 003600
250 species as endangered since 2008. Many of CBD's petitions—and lawsuits—are
still in the pipeline. About 97% of the species that are designated as endangerednever move off the list.Next March, Fish and Wildlife will make a determination about whether to add thelesser prairie chicken, found in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Kansas to the list.Harold Hamm, president of Continental Resources, says that the habitat for theprairie chicken overlaps "some of the most promising land for oil and gas leases inthe country."Many Westerners suspect that this environmental activism isn't only or even mostlyabout saving species and obscure subspecies. Instead, it is about restricting land useon hundreds of thousands of acres of private and state land. The concern is that ifthese species are listed as endangered, their habitat could be placed off limits foreconomic development.In the 1980s, environmentalists successfully used a listing of the Northern SpottedOwl as threatened to cripple the timber industry in Oregon and Washington, throwingmany thousands out of jobs. This is the playbook now being used by groups like theCBD—which boasts on its website of its desire to end most oil and gas production inthe United States.Since taking office, the Obama administration and its green allies inside and outsidefederal agencies have been making expanded use of a tactic called "sue and settle"to issue new and expensive regulations. Groups like CBD and WildEarth Guardians,for example, petition Fish and Wildlife to list a species as endangered. Otherenvironmental groups use a similar tactic to get new water and air regulations fromthe Environmental Protection Agency. Then, sometimes the very same day, theenvironmental groups file a lawsuit against Fish and Wildlife or the EPA to force thegovernment to act—arguing that the regulatory process is too slow.Amos Eno, a former Fish and Wildlife Service official who worked to save the grizzlybear and the condor, is critical of the tactic. Mr. Eno, who now runs Resources First,says the money wasted on these lawsuits could be used on conservation efforts toactually save species from extinction.Because the federal agencies include former employees of green organizations, sueand settle can be a collaborative, not adversarial, process. The agency may be onlytoo happy to sign a consent decree that courts then rubber stamp. Often, state andindustry officials directly affected by the settlements have no opportunity to weigh in.Increasingly, sue and settle is how rules are made in Washington. The U.S. Chamberof Commerce has found that more than 60 times in the last four years the EPAagreed to settlements with environmental groups to pass regulations that in somecases impose tens of billions of dollars of costs on industry and land owners. The fedshave even paid green groups millions of dollars in legal fees for the favor of suing thegovernment.The Obama administration didn't invent sue and settle, but the pace hasincreased dramatically since 2009—an era that Oklahoma Attorney GeneralScott Pruitt calls "sue and settle on steroids."Last September Mr. Pruitt and 11 state attorneys general presented aFreedom of Information Act request to investigate the communications
Feb-17-2017 003601
between the Obama administration and environmental litigants. Their
suspicion is that the two are secretly working hand in hand to grease theprocess of regulating industries it doesn't like. A year has passed, but theEPA has refused to fully comply.This summer Mr. Pruitt has joined with the other attorneys general—including from Texas and Utah—to sue the Obama administration tocomply with the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Pruitt also believes thatsue and settle "is an end run around the Administrative Procedures Act."This is the law that governs how regulations are promulgated, and requiresamong other things transparency and a reliance on science to justify newrules. "An administration which claims to only want to 'follow the science'has exploited a litigation mechanism to enact new rules imposed on uswithout reviewing the science," Mr. Pruitt says.The attorneys general also cite new EPA regional haze rules—which cameinto being because of sue and settle—that could raise electricity costs intheir states by as much as 20%. On behalf of his fellow attorneys general,Mr. Pruitt says that "we're very worried that under Obama sue and settlewill be used by the EPA to issue new regulations on fracking." This couldkneecap the oil and gas boom in Western states.In its report "Sue and Settle: Regulating Behind Closed Doors," the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce has counted more than 100 new major rules "with estimated compliancecosts of more than $100 million annually" that arose from this tactic. The result is agiant tax on the economy brought to you by the Sierra Club and the EnvironmentalDefense Fund with little or no input or oversight from Congress.Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) and Rep. Doug Collins (R., Ga.) have introduced"Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2013" that would require allproposed consent decrees to be posted for 60 days for public comment before beingfiled with a court—and allow affected parties to challenge them. Members ofCongress in both parties who are worried about the Obama regulatory assault willneed to take corrective action if they have any hope of a true economic turnaround.Mr. Moore is a member of the Journal's editorial board.

Allen: 
As you may or may not know, our Attorney General is supporting the merger between U.S. Air and
American Airlines. 
One of the issues that we believe is vital to this merger is the bargaining power of our
corporate citizens especially in regards to international travel. 
I'd like to talk with someone who handles
your negotiations and contracts with the airlines regarding Devon's travel. 
Basically, do they think a
stronger American/US airline would give them more or less choice? 
I have been told that it will give our
corporations more choice due to the fact the United and Delta are really the only players at this time. 
I
am contacting our larger corporations to ask them their opinion on this matter. 
Anything they tell me
would be considered confidential under our investigative powers.

Hi Clayton:
Per our conversation today, I am following up with a couple of items:
1.
As we discussed, below is Bill’s e-mail with attachments. Sorry, I gave Bill’s assistant a list of
recipients, and forgot to include you and Melissa (copied). 
2.
Also, our legal team took another review of the AG letter, and a good recommendation wasmade to include footnotes to source the quotes/legal arguments. The attached version is thesame one I originally sent to you, and which we just discussed, with the exception of theadded footnotes.
Thanks for putting the AG letter into action, and I think that this letter will make a strong statementand a real difference. Do you think that we will get any Democrats to sign the letter? Also, when youfinalize the document and send it out, can I please get a copy for my records?
Thanks again for your help, and let me know if you have any questions.

Just a note to provide you with Devon’s initial comments to the OMB Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs (OIRA) on the BLM’s newly proposed draft rule to place sweeping and unnecessaryfederal regulations on hydraulic fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands.
Feb-17-2017 003618
As you are preparing comments to be filed directly with the BLM by August 23, or are involved in other
matters surrounding the rule, we thought it would be helpful to share Devon’s current analysis andviews in the attached comments -- despite the fact that we fully expect to have an even morethorough understanding of the rule's costs, collection burdens, operational impacts and delays as wecontinue to analyze the new draft rule for our own August comments to BLM.
We believe it is important to note that the states — not the federal government — are best equipped todesign, administer and enforce laws and regulation related to oil and natural gas development. In fact,at the annual meeting of the Western Governors’ Association held in Park City, Utah, on June 28-30 apolicy resolution was adopted that stated (in part): “Western Governors recognize that the states,territories, and flag islands have effectively regulated the practice of hydraulic fracturing andredundant federal regulation is not required.”
In addition, the Federal Land Freedom Act (FLFA), which is also attached, was recently introduced inthe Senate. The Act demonstrates a strong commitment by a solid group of senators to adopt afederalism approach to energy development by empowering states to control all aspects of energydevelopment (leasing, permitting, regulation and enforcement) on federal lands within their borders.
States have an excellent record of protecting the environment and public health, while simultaneouslyfacilitating oil & natural gas development and promoting economic growth. Rather than force anunnecessary, one-size-fits-all regulatory regime on top of carefully crafted state-specific programs,BLM should instead work with states on how best to address any health, safety or environmental issuesarising from hydraulic fracturing and related operations on federal lands by deferring to proven stateregulatory and enforcement programs. By focusing too much on achieving “consistent” regulation (thatwe hear from DOI and BLM as being needed), rather than the 
best
 regulation, the BLM's proposalfundamentally ignores local and regional differences among states.
We hope that you find our filing useful. Also, please let us know if you have any questions or otherthoughts. And feel free to use and/or share Devon’s comments as you see fit.

Feb-17-2017 003621
I contacted the title attorney, Mr. Peoples, regarding the ownership issue for Section 15-3N-11E of
Coal
 
County,
 
OK. 
 
He
 
found
 
that
 
R.F.
 
Rush
 
was
 
erroneously
 
credited
 
with
 
the
 
5.8334
 
acres
 
and
 
that
the
 
correct
 
owner
 
of
 
the
 
5.8334
 
acres
 
was
 
J.F.
 
Rush. 
 
He
 
revised
 
the
 
title
 
opinion
 
to
 
reflect
 
this
 
and
submitted
 
a
 
transmittal
 
letter,
 
which
 
explains
 
the
 
correction. 
 
I’ve
 
attached
 
a
 
copy
 
for
 
your
 
file. 
Would
 
this
 
be
 
sufficient
 
for
 
the
 
OST
 
to
 
release
 
the
 
funds
 
to
 
the
 
heirs
 
of
 
J.F.
 
Rush? 
 
If
 
the
 
transmittal
letter
 
from
 
the
 
attorney
 
does
 
not
 
suffice,
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
necessary
 
requirements
 
for
 
the
 
affidavit? 
Previously,
 
you
 
stated

Subject:PSO IRP Contract- BPDate:07/18/2013 11:11 AMAttachments:
IRP Contract - BPC Signed.pdf
Here is the signed contract for the IRP. 
Note- the contract references the June date of the IRP, but as we
know there was some overlap that BP could segregate (as requested by PSO) from its May billings. 
It is
my understanding that there may be a small amount of work that BP can pull from May re the IRP and, as
requested, they will be/or already have separated all billing into the 3 matters. 
Accordingly, the May bill
will reflect some work on the IRP and BP will bill under the IRP. 
If there is any problem with this- it will
just remain under the 54 cause. 
Let me know if you have any questions. 
Thanks!

Here is the executed Wind Contract. 
On the IRP- do you have a preference on date- or adding a note that work began in May? 
BP is seeking
guidance on making sure no issue for getting paid for work that has been done prior to contract. 
Thanks.

PSO IRP Contract- BP 
Here is the signed contract for the IRP. 
Note- the contract references the June date of the IRP, but as we
know there was some overlap that BP could segregate (as requested by PSO) from its May billings. 
It is
my understanding that there may be a small amount of work that BP can pull from May re the IRP and, as
requested, they will be/or already have separated all billing into the 3 matters. 
Accordingly, the May bill
will reflect some work on the IRP and BP will bill under the IRP. 
If there is any problem with this- it will
just remain under the 54 cause. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Here is the executed Wind Contract.
On the IRP- do you have a preference on date- or adding a note that work began in
May?
 BP is seeking guidance on making sure no issue for getting paid for work that
has been done prior to contract.
 Thanks.

Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)
Storm Outage Update #2:
 Wednesday, July 24, 2013 – 4:30 p.m.
PSO
is
dealing
with
significant
weather-related
power
outages
across
the
Tulsa
metropolitan
area
due
to
a
severe
thunderstorm
packing
60-80
mph
winds
that
struck
in
the
early
morning
hours.
 OUTAGES AND RESTORATION EFFORTSTulsa District
As
of
4:30
p.m.
Wednesday,
July
24,
PSO
had
restored
power
to
about
20,000
customers
who
lost
service
in
the
early
morning
storm,
leaving
approximately
76,300
customers
in
the
Tulsa
metro
area
without
electric
service. 
PSO
has
restored
service
to
16
main
feeder
power
lines,
with
76
still
out
of
operation.
Customer
outages
continue
to
be
most
numerous
in
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
metro
area.
At
present,
there
are
approximately
370
PSO
line
and
tree
workers
focused
on
restoring
power
in
the
Tulsa
metro
area. 
PSO
has
secured
an
additional
1,030
workers
from
other
AEP
companies
and
other
utilities
to
support
restoration
efforts.
Based
on
damage
assessment,
and
barring
any
future
weather
events,
PSO
estimates
it
could
take
until
5
p.m.,
Sunday,
July
28,
to
complete
power
restoration
to
95%
of
all
customers
who
can
take
service.
The
electric
service
to
many
customers
will
be
restored
much
sooner
than
that
time. 
This
initial
estimated
time
for
completing
power
restoration
will
be
updated
as
the
storm
recovery
work
progresses.
In
accordance
with
pre-arranged
plans,
PSO
will
use
a
portion
of
Expo
Square
for
parking
the
work
vehicles
of
out-of-town
crews,
for
refueling
vehicles,
and
for
staging
materials.
 CUSTOMER MESSAGES
Customers
should
prepare
for
a
multi-day
power
outage
and
are
urged
to
take
necessary
steps
to
ensure
their
health
and
safety
while
Feb-17-2017 003814
PSO works to restore power.
For
safety’s
sake,
assume
that
any
downed
utility
line
is
energized
with
deadly
electric
current. 
Stay
away
from
the
line
and
do
not
touch
it
with
anything. 
Report
it
to
PSO
at
1-888-216-3523.
 
Please
do
not
approach
crews
and
utility
vehicles
you
see
in
your
neighborhood
to
ask
when
power
will
be
restored. 
Doing
so
could
jeopardize
your
safety. 
Outward
vision
from
the
large
utility
vehicles
can
be
limited. 
A
crew
may
not
see
someone
who
has
walked
up
to
their
work
truck.
 INFORMATION
We
will
continue
to
provide
additional
information
to
you
as
the
restoration
effort
moves
forward.

I believe that is what Brandy advised Alan- BP is separating its invoices out for the 3 separate matters
(54, Wind, and IRP). 
I will let Brandy confirm if this is correct to have 3 separate contracts (I believe that
is what was determined, but this is not my call so want to ensure I do not misrepresent what I
understood).

Nicole:
It is also my understanding from Alan that BP will bill for their review of the 2013 update to the IRP on a
separate contract as well. 
Here is draft of that for circulation and review.

It is also my understanding from Alan that BP will bill for their review of the 2013 update to the IRP on a
separate contract as well.

I just verified with Judge Myles that you communicated with him that your client tookno position to PUD’s motion; therefore, the last sentence of paragraph 4 on page 2 inthe order says, “All other parties stated that they either supported, did not oppose, or
took no position to PUD’s Motion.”
 Is this acceptable to you and all other parties?

I quoted from OIEC’s Response to PUD’s Motion to Lift Stay and Dismiss Cause and inparagraph 2, OIEC used the word “prudency” so unless there is an objection, I’ll letthat word remain as is.

I just verified with Judge Myles that you communicated with him that your client tookno position to PUD’s motion; therefore, the last sentence of paragraph 4 on page 2 inthe order says, “All other parties stated that they either supported, did not oppose, or
took no position to PUD’s Motion.”
 Is this acceptable to you and all other parties?

I quoted from OIEC’s Response to PUD’s Motion to Lift Stay and Dismiss Cause and inparagraph 2, OIEC used the word “prudency” so unless there is an objection, I’ll letthat word remain as is.
Thank you.

Deborah,
I
just
verified
with
Judge
Myles
that
you
communicated
with
him
that
your
client
took
no
position
to
PUD’s
motion;
therefore,
the
last
sentence
of
paragraph
4
on
page
2
in
the
order
says,
“All
other
parties
stated
that
they
either
supported,
did
not
oppose,
or
took
no
position
to
PUD’s
Motion.”
 Is
this
acceptable
to
you
and
all
other
parties?

 Patrick B. McGuigan Published: 29-Jul-2013 
 OKLAHOMA CITY – Despite an adverse circuit court ruling rebuffing the state of Oklahoma’s legalchallenge to an Environmental Protection Agency (APA) edict, a citizen activist group is continuing to fightthe controversial regional haze standard that could require Oklahoma power plants to switch fuels tooffset sulfur dioxide emissions. 
 Federal pressure on power generation in Oklahoma could have real-world implications, including aminimum 11-12 percent rate hike for residential consumers. While several state officials have opposedthe EPA maneuvers, some state officials have recently been quiet, and a key state utility firm has agreedto changes that will hike utility rates. 
 EPA critics have assailed underlying authority for the regulatory provision, which is based on a 1977amendment to the federal Clean Air Act. They decry it as “an aesthetic visibility standard” designed toreduce haze on government lands, with little gain for air quality. 
 Further, Americans for Prosperity-Oklahoma, says the projected double-digit rate hikes, if the EPA getsits way, will actually be closer to 20 percent – an average of $200 in increased costs for the typical statefamily. 
 Matt Ball, state director for AFP-OK, said, “At a time when Oklahomans overwhelmingly agree thatelectricity rates are already too high, why should state policymakers support a settlement agreement withthe Obama EPA and other liberal environmental groups like the Sierra Club that will raise rates on PSO[Public Service Company of Oklahoma] customers up to $200 more per year and pave the way for ratesto be raised on all Oklahomans?” 
 Ball continued, “President Obama has made clear his intentions on power plant regulation and this oneEPA regulation, by mandating fuel-switching, will effectively mandate how much Oklahomans will pay forelectricity.” 
 Last weekend, Ball told CapitolBeatOK the petition already had triggered 3,078 Oklahomans to contactstate officials via the petition letters. 
 Ball said, “While the heavy-handed approach of President Obama’s EPA is likely to result in utility ratehikes on Oklahoma families and businesses, what is more troubling is that state policymakers mightconsider supporting it. This plan hurts Oklahomans’ pocketbooks and makes our state less competitivefor jobs. AFP-OK is circulating this petition so that state policymakers are made aware of howOklahomans feel about this important pocketbook issue.” 
 In the first of a series of emails to AFP supporters and other free market advocates in the state, Ballassailed the EPA benchmark as operating “under the guise of pseudo-science.” 
 Commissioner of Labor Mark Costello told CapitolBeatOK, “Should this EPA mandated policy beimplemented in our state, I have serious concerns about the negative impact on Oklahoma's wageearners.” He asserted, “There is no urgent need for the state of Oklahoma to rush into embracing a policybased solely on EPA demands. This issue needs to be fully 'vetted' by the Oklahoma Corporation
Feb-17-2017 003911
Commission.” 
 That three-member commission is the constitutional state agency that regulates many businesses,including all utility companies. 
Costello and other critics 
of the haze mandate say 
it could erode two of Oklahoma’s key economic
advantages
 – comparatively robust employment (a 5 percent jobless rate, among the nation’s lowest) andlow cost of doing business, not to mention wage improvements over several years 
 The Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers (OIEC) and the state Energy Coalition have faced off withstate members of 
the Sierra Club, who back the haze rule
. 
 Frustrating advocates of energy independence, the EPA applied the regional haze standard to theWichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge near Lawton, in southwestern Oklahoma. EPA has pressuredfor fuel switching (from “clean coal” to natural gas) at power plants more than 250 miles away, in the farnortheast corner of the Sooner State. 
 The situation has provoked unusual division among utility firms. While Public Service Company ofOklahoma (PSO) is willing to settle with EPA, the Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) has fought theissue in court. 
 Last Friday (July 26), 
a divided Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel rejected Oklahoma’s April 2012
petition
 to rebuff the EPA’s haze rule, 
issued in December 2011. 
 Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt assailed the Tenth Circuit decision, saying, “We disagree and aredisappointed with the panel’s 2-1 decision. We will continue to fight to preserve the ability of Oklahomastakeholders to create an Oklahoma solution and to protect Oklahoma consumers from excessive andunnecessary utility costs. We are reviewing the decision and considering our options.” 
 U.S. Rep. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma City, said he was “frustrated” with the circuit court ruling, whichhe characterizes as “needless and excessive.” Unless the ruling is tempered upon further review, “It isnow certain that Oklahoma utility customers will face a new rate hike without any health or economicbenefit.” 
 In addition to fighting the circuit ruling, Pruitt is part of a coalition of state attorneys general seeking tounderstand the EPA’s alleged “sue and settle” strategy. A federal lawsuit against EPA, filed inOklahoma’s western district, seeks disclosure of EPA tactics benefiting environmental groups likeGreenpeace, Defenders of Wildlife, Wildearth Guardians and the Sierra Club. 
 Pruitt characterizes “sue-and-settle” and the regional haze controversy as part of a “blatant strategy bythe EPA to go around the process and bend the rules to create environmental regulations that have failedin Congress.” In a total of 45 settlements already made public, EPA has paid out nearly $1 million inattorneys’ fees to environmental groups, Pruitt and the other state AGs assert. 
 Earlier this year, the states of Oklahoma, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, NorthDakota, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyoming submitted to EPA a federal open records requestfocused on the “sue-and-settle” strategy.

OKLAHOMA CITY
 –
Despite
an
adverse
circuit
court
ruling
rebuffing
the
state
of
Oklahoma’s
legal
challenge
to
an
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(APA)
edict,
a
citizen
activist
group
is
continuing
to
fight
the
controversial
regional
haze
standard
that
could
require
Oklahoma
power
plants
to
switch
fuels
to
offset
sulfur
dioxide
emissions.
Federal
pressure
on
power
generation
in
Oklahoma
could
have
real-world
implications,
including
a
minimum
11-12
percent
rate
hike
for
residential
consumers.
While
several
state
officials
have
opposed
the
EPA
maneuvers,
some
state
officials
have
recently
been
quiet,
and
a
key
state
utility
firm
has
agreed
to
changes
that
will
hike
utility
rates.
EPA
critics
have
assailed
underlying
authority
for
the
regulatory
provision,
which
is
based
on
a
1977
amendment
to
the
federal
Clean
Air
Act.
They
decry
it
as
“an
aesthetic
visibility
standard”
designed
to
reduce
haze
on
government
lands,
with
little
gain
for
air
quality.
Further,
Americans
for
Prosperity-Oklahoma,
says
the
projected
double-digit
rate
hikes,
if
the
EPA
gets
its
way,
will
actually
be
closer
to
20
percent
–
an
average
of
$200
in
increased
costs
for
the
typical
state
family. 
Matt
Ball,
state
director
for
AFP-OK,
said,
“At
a
time
when
Oklahomans
overwhelmingly
agree
that
electricity
rates
are
already
too
high,
why
should
state
policymakers
support
a
settlement
agreement
with
the
Obama
EPA
and
other
liberal
environmental
groups
like
the
Sierra
Club
that
will
raise
rates
on
PSO
[Public
Service
Company
of
Oklahoma]
customers
up
to
$200
more
per
year
and
pave
the
way
for
rates
to
be
raised
on
all
Oklahomans?”
Ball
continued,
“President
Obama
has
made
clear
his
intentions
on
power
plant
regulation
and
this
one
EPA
regulation,
by
mandating
fuel-switching,
will
effectively
mandate
how
much
Oklahomans
will
pay
for
electricity.”
Last weekend, Ball told CapitolBeatOK the petition already had triggered 3,078 Oklahomans to
Feb-17-2017 003916
contact state officials via the petition letters.
Ball
said,
“While
the
heavy-handed
approach
of
President
Obama’s
EPA
is
likely
to
result
in
utility
rate
hikes
on
Oklahoma
families
and
businesses,
what
is
more
troubling
is
that
state
policymakers
might
consider
supporting
it.
This
plan
hurts
Oklahomans’
pocketbooks
and
makes
our
state
less
competitive
for
jobs.
AFP-OK
is
circulating
this
petition
so
that
state
policymakers
are
made
aware
of
how
Oklahomans
feel
about
this
important
pocketbook
issue.”
In
the
first
of
a
series
of
emails
to
AFP
supporters
and
other
free
market
advocates
in
the
state,
Ball
assailed
the
EPA
benchmark
as
operating
“under
the
guise
of
pseudo-science.” 
Commissioner
of
Labor
Mark
Costello
told
CapitolBeatOK,
“Should
this
EPA
mandated
policy
be
implemented
in
our
state,
I
have
serious
concerns
about
the
negative
impact
on
Oklahoma's
wage
earners.”
He
asserted,
“There
is
no
urgent
need
for
the
state
of
Oklahoma
to
rush
into
embracing
a
policy
based
solely
on
EPA
demands.
This
issue
needs
to
be
fully
'vetted'
by
the
Oklahoma
Corporation
Commission.” 
That
three-member
commission
is
the
constitutional
state
agency
that
regulates
many
businesses,
including
all
utility
companies. 
Costello
and
other
critics 
of
the
haze
mandate
say 
it
could
erode
two
of
Oklahoma’s
key
economic
advantages
 –
comparatively
robust
employment
(a
5
percent
jobless
rate,
among
the
nation’s
lowest)
and
low
cost
of
doing
business,
not
to
mention
wage
improvements
over
several
years
The
Oklahoma
Industrial
Energy
Consumers
(OIEC)
and
the
state
Energy
Coalition
have
faced
off
with
state
members
of 
the
Sierra
Club,
who
back
the
haze
rule
. 
Frustrating
advocates
of
energy
independence,
the
EPA
applied
the
regional
haze
standard
to
the
Wichita
Mountains
National
Wildlife
Refuge
near
Lawton,
in
southwestern
Oklahoma.
EPA
has
pressured
for
fuel
switching
(from
“clean
coal”
to
natural
gas)
at
power
plants
more
than
250
miles
away,
in
the
far
northeast
corner
of
the
Sooner
State.
The
situation
has
provoked
unusual
division
among
utility
firms.
While
Public
Service
Company
of
Oklahoma
(PSO)
is
willing
to
settle
with
EPA,
the
Oklahoma
Gas
and
Electric
(OG&E)
has
fought
the
issue
in
court.
Last
Friday
(July
26), 
a
divided
Tenth
U.S.
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
panel
rejected
Oklahoma’s
April
2012
petition
 to
rebuff
the
EPA’s
haze
rule,
 issued
in
December
2011. 
Oklahoma
Attorney
General
Scott
Pruitt
assailed
the
Tenth
Circuit
decision,
saying,
“We
disagree
and
are
disappointed
with
the
panel’s
2-1
decision.
We
will
continue
to
fight
to
preserve
the
ability
of
Oklahoma
stakeholders
to
create
an
Oklahoma
solution
and
to
protect
Oklahoma
consumers
from
excessive
and
unnecessary
utility
costs.
We
are
reviewing
the
decision
and
considering
our
options.”
U.S.
Rep.
James
Lankford,
R-Oklahoma
City,
said
he
was
“frustrated”
with
the
circuit
court
ruling,
which
he
characterizes
as
“needless
and
excessive.”
Unless
the
ruling
is
tempered
upon
further
review, “It is now certain that Oklahoma utility customers will face a new rate hike without any
Feb-17-2017 003917
health or economic benefit.”
In
addition
to
fighting
the
circuit
ruling,
Pruitt
is
part
of
a
coalition
of
state
attorneys
general
seeking
to
understand
the
EPA’s
alleged
“sue
and
settle”
strategy.
A
federal
lawsuit
against
EPA,
filed
in
Oklahoma’s
western
district,
seeks
disclosure
of
EPA
tactics
benefiting
environmental
groups
like
Greenpeace,
Defenders
of
Wildlife,
Wildearth
Guardians
and
the
Sierra
Club. 
Pruitt
characterizes
“sue-and-settle”
and
the
regional
haze
controversy
as
part
of
a
“blatant
strategy
by
the
EPA
to
go
around
the
process
and
bend
the
rules
to
create
environmental
regulations
that
have
failed
in
Congress.”
In
a
total
of
45
settlements
already
made
public,
EPA
has
paid
out
nearly
$1
million
in
attorneys’
fees
to
environmental
groups,
Pruitt
and
the
other
state
AGs
assert. 
Earlier
this
year,
the
states
of
Oklahoma,
Alabama,
Arizona,
Georgia,
Kansas,
Michigan,
Nebraska,
North
Dakota,
South
Carolina,
Texas,
Utah
and
Wyoming
submitted
to
EPA
a
federal
open
records
request
focused
on
the
“sue-and-settle”
strategy.

We have to file by October 11. Our internal goal is to get it on file by the first or second. We couldput in the order no later than October 11. That way if, for example, there is a bust on one of theschedules we will not be out of compliance with the procedural order.

PSO is willing to go first (without a fight) if PSO can go last as well. To me we have conflicting ruleswith the one saying the applicant goes first and another that says in a fuel review the company hasthe burden of proof. There are only four parties so this should not be a problem.That procedure hasbeen approved before.

Tom,
PSO said that it wanted a cut-off date for discovery on the testimony in support of the MFRs –
November 8, 2013, 
and also said that it needed 8 business days for discovery.
 PUD is fine with that.
No other party has proposed any changes to dates.
 I have not drafted an order.
 Now, we are just
trying to agree on dates and the terms of discovery to present to the judge on tomorrow.
Jack,
What is the date for PSO’s filing of the MFR and its testimony in support?
 I do not have a problem
with that date being included in the order once it is drafted.
All, what about letting the judge decide at the pre-hearing conference the order of presentation ofwitnesses at the hearing on the merits?
To my understanding, based on what I have heard from all parties, except OIEC, the following is theproposed schedule and discovery terms:
November 8, 2013Cut-off for discovery on the testimony filed on
Feb-17-2017 003926

I would like to advise Judge Candler as soon as possible what the parties have decided.
Thank you.

We couldput in the order no later than October 11. That way if, for example, there is a bust on one of theschedules we will not be out of compliance with the procedural order.

PSO is willing to go first (without a fight) if PSO can go last as well. To me we have conflicting ruleswith the one saying the applicant goes first and another that says in a fuel review the company hasthe burden of proof. There are only four parties so this should not be a problem.That procedure hasbeen approved before.

Tom,
PSO said that it wanted a cut-off date for discovery on the testimony in support of the MFRs –
November 8, 2013, 
and also said that it needed 8 business days for discovery.
 PUD is fine with that.
No other party has proposed any changes to dates.
 I have not drafted an order.
 Now, we are just
trying to agree on dates and the terms of discovery to present to the judge on tomorrow.
Jack,
What is the date for PSO’s filing of the MFR and its testimony in support?
 I do not have a problem
with that date being included in the order once it is drafted.
All, what about letting the judge decide at the pre-hearing conference the order of presentation ofwitnesses at the hearing on the merits?
To my understanding, based on what I have heard from all parties, except OIEC, the following is theproposed schedule and discovery terms:
November 8, 2013Cut-off for discovery on the testimony filed on________by PSO in support of the MFR.November 19, 2013Responsive Testimony FiledDecember 9, 2013Statements of Position FiledDecember 19, 2013Discovery Cut-Off (Responsive Testimony)January 13, 2014Rebuttal Testimony FiledFebruary 10, 2014Discovery Cut-Off (Rebuttal Testimony)February 24, 2014Pre-hearing Motions FiledMarch 12, 2014Settlement ConferenceMarch 13, 2014, 10:30 a.m.Pre-Hearing ConferenceMarch 20, 2014Exhibit Lists and Witness Summaries FiledMarch 27, 2014, 10:30 a.m.Hearing on the Merits
All discovery requests shall be due within 8 business days of receipt, objections to any discoveryrequest will be due within 3 business days, and data requests limited to no more than 25 per dayper party.
Feb-17-2017 003935
Order of Presentation of witnesses?
All, please press “reply all” so that all parties can know what is being proposed.
I would like to advise Judge Candler as soon as possible what the parties have decided.
Thank you.

Subject:RE: 2013_128 PSO FAC & Prudence Review 2012 Procedural ScheduleDate:09/18/2013 04:10 PMPSO is willing to go first (without a fight) if PSO can go last as well.

Tom,
PSO said that it wanted a cut-off date for discovery on the testimony in support of the MFRs –
November 8, 2013, 
and also said that it needed 8 business days for discovery.
 PUD is fine with that.
No other party has proposed any changes to dates.
 I have not drafted an order.
 Now, we are just
trying to agree on dates and the terms of discovery to present to the judge on tomorrow.
Jack,
What is the date for PSO’s filing of the MFR and its testimony in support?
 I do not have a problem
with that date being included in the order once it is drafted.
All, what about letting the judge decide at the pre-hearing conference the order of presentation ofwitnesses at the hearing on the merits?
To my understanding, based on what I have heard from all parties, except OIEC, the following is theproposed schedule and discovery terms:
November 8, 2013Cut-off for discovery on the testimony filed on________by PSO in support of the MFR.November 19, 2013Responsive Testimony FiledDecember 9, 2013Statements of Position FiledDecember 19, 2013Discovery Cut-Off (Responsive Testimony)January 13, 2014Rebuttal Testimony FiledFebruary 10, 2014Discovery Cut-Off (Rebuttal Testimony)

I would like to advise Judge Candler as soon as possible what the parties have decided.

Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)
Storm Outage Update #2:
 Wednesday, July 24, 2013 –
4:30 p.m. 
PSO
is
dealing
with
significant
weather-related
power
outages
across
the
Tulsa
metropolitan
area
due
to
a
severe
thunderstorm
packing
60-80
mph
winds
that
struck
in
the
early
morning
hours.
 OUTAGES AND RESTORATION EFFORTSTulsa District
As
of
4:30
p.m.
Wednesday,
July
24,
PSO
had
restored
power
to
about
20,000
customers
who
lost
service
in
the
early
morning
storm,
leaving
approximately
76,300
customers
in
the
Tulsa
metro
area
without
electric
service. 
PSO
has
restored
service
to
16
main
feeder
power
lines,
with
76
still
out
of
operation.
Customer
outages
continue
to
be
most
numerous
in
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
metro
area.
At
present,
there
are
approximately
370
PSO
line
and
tree
workers
focused
on
restoring
power
in
the
Tulsa
metro
area. 
PSO
has
secured
an
additional
1,030
workers
from
other
AEP
companies
and
other
utilities
to
support
restoration
efforts.
Based
on
damage
assessment,
and
barring
any
future
weather
events,
PSO
estimates
it
could
take
until
5
p.m.,
Sunday,
July
28,
to
complete
power
restoration
to
95%
of
all
customers
who
can
take
service.
The
electric
service
to
many
customers
will
be
restored
much
sooner
than
that
time.
This
initial
estimated
time
for
completing
power
restoration
will
be
updated
as
the
storm
recovery
work
progresses.
Feb-17-2017 003954
In
accordance
with
pre-arranged
plans,
PSO
will
use
a
portion
of
Expo
Square
for
parking
the
work
vehicles
of
out-of-town
crews,
for
refueling
vehicles,
and
for
staging
materials.
 CUSTOMER MESSAGES
Customers
should
prepare
for
a
multi-day
power
outage
and
are
urged
to
take
necessary
steps
to
ensure
their
health
and
safety
while
PSO
works
to
restore
power.
For
safety’s
sake,
assume
that
any
downed
utility
line
is
energized
with
deadly
electric
current. 
Stay
away
from
the
line
and
do
not
touch
it
with
anything. 
Report
it
to
PSO
at
1-888-216-3523. 
Please
do
not
approach
crews
and
utility
vehicles
you
see
in
your
neighborhood
to
ask
when
power
will
be
restored. 
Doing
so
could
jeopardize
your
safety. 
Outward
vision
from
the
large
utility
vehicles
can
be
limited. 
A
crew
may
not
see
someone
who
has
walked
up
to
their
work
truck.
 INFORMATION
We
will
continue
to
provide
additional
information
to
you
as
the
restoration
effort
moves
forward.

Jack, regarding the proposed Order, I see a typo under the heading “appearances” 
on page 1 (for
OIEC). Jennifer’s last name is Castillo not Costello. Also, regarding appearances for the A G, it shouldbe changed to read Jerry Sanger, not James Sanger. That is all the changes I have thus far.

Deborah,
I just verified with Judge Myles that you communicated with him that your client took no position toPUD’s motion; therefore, the last sentence of paragraph 4 on page 2 in the order says, “All otherparties stated that they either supported, did not oppose, or took no position to PUD’s
Motion.”
 Is this acceptable to you and all other parties?
Judith

I quoted from OIEC’s Response to PUD’s Motion to Lift Stay and Dismiss Cause and in paragraph 2,OIEC used the word “prudency” so unless there is an objection, I’ll let that word remain as is.
Thank you.

Capitol Beat Story  Melissa, I wanted to check with you on a statement in the story below. Ihighlighted a sentence near the end that is partially a Pruitt quote but alsomentions regional haze. Has AG Pruitt characterized regional haze along
with “sue and settle” as this sentence implies?

 OKLAHOMA CITY – Despite an adverse circuit court ruling rebuffing the state of Oklahoma’s legalchallenge to an Environmental Protection Agency (APA) edict, a citizen activist group is continuing to fightthe controversial regional haze standard that could require Oklahoma power plants to switch fuels tooffset sulfur dioxide emissions. 
Feb-17-2017 004014
Federal pressure on power generation in Oklahoma could have real-world implications, including a
minimum 11-12 percent rate hike for residential consumers. While several state officials have opposedthe EPA maneuvers, some state officials have recently been quiet, and a key state utility firm has agreedto changes that will hike utility rates. 
 EPA critics have assailed underlying authority for the regulatory provision, which is based on a 1977amendment to the federal Clean Air Act. They decry it as “an aesthetic visibility standard” designed toreduce haze on government lands, with little gain for air quality. 
 Further, Americans for Prosperity-Oklahoma, says the projected double-digit rate hikes, if the EPA getsits way, will actually be closer to 20 percent – an average of $200 in increased costs for the typical statefamily. 
 Matt Ball, state director for AFP-OK, said, “At a time when Oklahomans overwhelmingly agree thatelectricity rates are already too high, why should state policymakers support a settlement agreement withthe Obama EPA and other liberal environmental groups like the Sierra Club that will raise rates on PSO[Public Service Company of Oklahoma] customers up to $200 more per year and pave the way for ratesto be raised on all Oklahomans?” 
 Ball continued, “President Obama has made clear his intentions on power plant regulation and this oneEPA regulation, by mandating fuel-switching, will effectively mandate how much Oklahomans will pay forelectricity.” 
 Last weekend, Ball told CapitolBeatOK the petition already had triggered 3,078 Oklahomans to contactstate officials via the petition letters. 
 Ball said, “While the heavy-handed approach of President Obama’s EPA is likely to result in utility ratehikes on Oklahoma families and businesses, what is more troubling is that state policymakers mightconsider supporting it. This plan hurts Oklahomans’ pocketbooks and makes our state less competitivefor jobs. AFP-OK is circulating this petition so that state policymakers are made aware of howOklahomans feel about this important pocketbook issue.” 
 In the first of a series of emails to AFP supporters and other free market advocates in the state, Ballassailed the EPA benchmark as operating “under the guise of pseudo-science.” 
 Commissioner of Labor Mark Costello told CapitolBeatOK, “Should this EPA mandated policy beimplemented in our state, I have serious concerns about the negative impact on Oklahoma's wageearners.” He asserted, “There is no urgent need for the state of Oklahoma to rush into embracing a policybased solely on EPA demands. This issue needs to be fully 'vetted' by the Oklahoma CorporationCommission.” 
 That three-member commission is the constitutional state agency that regulates many businesses,including all utility companies. 
Costello and other critics 
of the haze mandate say 
it could erode two of Oklahoma’s key economic
advantages
 – comparatively robust employment (a 5 percent jobless rate, among the nation’s lowest) andlow cost of doing business, not to mention wage improvements over several years 
 The Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers (OIEC) and the state Energy Coalition have faced off withstate members of 
the Sierra Club, who back the haze rule
. 
 Frustrating advocates of energy independence, the EPA applied the regional haze standard to theWichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge near Lawton, in southwestern Oklahoma. EPA has pressuredfor fuel switching (from “clean coal” to natural gas) at power plants more than 250 miles away, in the farnortheast corner of the Sooner State. 
Feb-17-2017 004015
The situation has provoked unusual division among utility firms. While Public Service Company ofOklahoma (PSO) is willing to settle with EPA, the Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) has fought theissue in court. 
 Last Friday (July 26), 
a divided Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel rejected Oklahoma’s April 2012
petition
 to rebuff the EPA’s haze rule, 
issued in December 2011. 
 Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt assailed the Tenth Circuit decision, saying, “We disagree and aredisappointed with the panel’s 2-1 decision. We will continue to fight to preserve the ability of Oklahomastakeholders to create an Oklahoma solution and to protect Oklahoma consumers from excessive andunnecessary utility costs. We are reviewing the decision and considering our options.” 
 U.S. Rep. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma City, said he was “frustrated” with the circuit court ruling, whichhe characterizes as “needless and excessive.” Unless the ruling is tempered upon further review, “It isnow certain that Oklahoma utility customers will face a new rate hike without any health or economicbenefit.” 
 In addition to fighting the circuit ruling, Pruitt is part of a coalition of state attorneys general seeking tounderstand the EPA’s alleged “sue and settle” strategy. A federal lawsuit against EPA, filed inOklahoma’s western district, seeks disclosure of EPA tactics benefiting environmental groups likeGreenpeace, Defenders of Wildlife, Wildearth Guardians and the Sierra Club. 
 Pruitt characterizes “sue-and-settle” and the regional haze controversy as part of a “blatant strategy bythe EPA to go around the process and bend the rules to create environmental regulations that have failedin Congress.” In a total of 45 settlements already made public, EPA has paid out nearly $1 million inattorneys’ fees to environmental groups, Pruitt and the other state AGs assert. 
 Earlier this year, the states of Oklahoma, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, NorthDakota, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyoming submitted to EPA a federal open records requestfocused on the “sue-and-settle” strategy.

To my knowledge we have not been presented with a contract ready for execution for the

Once we have an executed contract I will begin processing
those invoices for payment. 
I will submit for payment the invoice for work in PUD201200054 today.

Subject:RE: TimelineDate:07/25/2013 09:09 AMGood morning Bud! General Pruitt said that the crews did show up last night around 6pm and were able to find the issue and
said he should have power last night around 8 or 8:30. 
However, that did not happen. He was wondering
if there was any more information on a new estimated time frame. Thanks again, I really appreciate your efforts on this. Ashley Ashley Olmstead Executive Assistant Oklahoma Office of Attorney General (405) 521.3921 313 NE 21st Street Oklahoma City, OK 73105

Storm Outage Update #2: 
Wednesday, July 24, 2013 – 4:30 p.m.
PSO
is
dealing
with
significant
weather-related
power
outages
across
the
Tulsa
metropolitan
area
due
to
a
severe
thunderstorm
packing
60-80
mph
winds
that
struck
in
the
early
morning
hours.
   OUTAGES AND RESTORATION EFFORTS Tulsa District 
As
of
4:30
p.m.
Wednesday,
July
24,
PSO
had
restored
power
to
about
20,000
customers
who
lost
service
in
the
early
morning
storm,
leaving
approximately
76,300
customers
in
the
Tulsa
metro
area
without
electric
service.
 PSO
has
restored
service
to
16
main
feeder
power
lines,
with
76
still
out
of
operation.
Feb-17-2017 004059
Customer
outages
continue
to
be
most
numerous
in
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
metro
area.
At
present,
there
are
approximately
370
PSO
line
and
tree
workers
focused
on
restoring
power
in
the
Tulsa
metro
area.
 PSO
has
secured
an
additional
1,030
workers
from
other
AEP
companies
and
other
utilities
to
support
restoration
efforts.
Based
on
damage
assessment,
and
barring
any
future
weather
events,
PSO
estimates
it
could
take
until
5
p.m.,
Sunday,
July
28,
to
complete
power
restoration
to
95%
of
all
customers
who
can
take
service.
The
electric
service
to
many
customers
will
be
restored
much
sooner
than
that
time.   
This
initial
estimated
time
for
completing
power
restoration
will
be
updated
as
the
storm
recovery
work
progresses.
In
accordance
with
pre-arranged
plans,
PSO
will
use
a
portion
of
Expo
Square
for
parking
the
work
vehicles
of
out-of-town
crews,
for
refueling
vehicles,
and
for
staging
materials.
   CUSTOMER MESSAGES
Customers
should
prepare
for
a
multi-day
power
outage
and
are
urged
to
take
necessary
steps
to
ensure
their
health
and
safety
while
PSO
works
to
restore
power.
For
safety’s
sake,
assume
that
any
downed
utility
line
is
energized
with
deadly
electric
current.
 Stay
away
from
the
line
and
do
not
touch
it
with
anything.
 Report
it
to
PSO
at
1-888-216-3523.
  
Please
do
not
approach
crews
and
utility
vehicles
you
see
in
your
neighborhood
to
ask
when
power
will
be
restored.
 Doing
so
could
jeopardize
your
safety.
 Outward
vision
from
the
large
utility
vehicles
can
be
limited.
 A
crew
may
not
see
someone
who
has
walked
up
to
their
work
truck.
  INFORMATION 
We
will
continue
to
provide
additional
information
to
you
as

Ratherthan wait for the Commission to issue an order I propose to just send out the document and havethose of you who want to see the information (other than OCC) sign and return.

2012_168 PSO FAC
 FINAL ORDER
Date:07/10/2013 09:45 AMAccording to Fairo Mitchell, PUD is fine with allowing PSO to rely upon the pre-filed testimony at theHOM as long as the parties are going to limit any cross examination questions to what PUD did and
not ask questions to PUD that are more appropriate for a PSO witness.
 As I said earlier, the judge
still wants PUD to testify briefly about its review.
 Javad Seyedoff and Larry Lago will be testifying on
behalf of PUD.
I will get back with the attorneys concerning edits to the draft order.
Thank you.

Subject:Re: Draft BP Contract for Review of PSO's 2013 Wind RFPDate:07/01/2013 04:05 PMI believe that is what Brandy advised Alan- BP is separating its invoices out for the 3 separate matters
(54, Wind, and IRP). 
I will let Brandy confirm if this is correct to have 3 separate contracts (I believe that
is what was determined, but this is not my call so want to ensure I do not misrepresent what I
understood). 
Thanks!

I amworking on a confidentiality agreement based on what the Commission has been approving. Ratherthan wait for the Commission to issue an order I propose to just send out the document and havethose of you who want to see the information (other than OCC) sign and return. Since the pricing onwind contracts has been kept confidential in the past to me this was an easier solution. Jack

It

it
 
does
 
not
 
appear
 
that
 
a
 
hearing
 
is
 
required

arises

on
 
my

Paragraph
 
5,

separate matters (54, Wind, and IRP).
 I will let Brandy confirm if this is correct to
have 3 separate contracts (I believe that is what was determined, but this is not my
call so want to ensure I do not misrepresent what I understood).

Re: AFP town hall So would the AG be opposed to anyone in the town hall/panel discussion 
Feb-17-2017 004273
discussing PSO settlement?  I would be looking to him for the messaging
points that you mention below. 
Heavy hand of federal govt infringing on
 states rights by mandating how much Oklahomans pay for electricity.
Frankly, our messaging has been mostly identical. 
But our petition letter
 is aimed at the settlement agreement bc we believe it paves the way for rate increases on all. Frankly, I just assume the AG and Lankford talk sue and settle, how the EPA is deploying these tactics and what their respective offices have done on oversight and litigation, and let Yeatman from CEI give an objective 
analysis of costs to ratepayers 
from revised state implementation plan on
regional haze (which includes the PSO rate increase). 
That way you guys
 dont have to deliver those messages and can focus on what the AG does best, opposing the Obama administration and its nasty tactics on the environment. 
Would you guys be opposed to that?

Hi
 
Matt,
 
Feb-17-2017 004283
 
I’ve
 
an
 
important
 
question:
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
anyone
 
on
 
Scott
 
Pruitt’s
 
team?
 
I
 
ask
 
b/c
 
I’ve
 
information
 
that
 
perhaps
 
they
were
 
unaware
 
of,
 
and
 
which
 
I
 
believe
 
would
 
help
 
their
 
en
 
banc
 
appeal.
 
I
 
explain
 
below.
 
  
The
 
majority
 
opinion’s
 
logic
 
rested
 
almost
 
entirely
 
on
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
EPA’s
 
consultant,
 
Dr.
 
Phyllis
 
Fox.
 
In
 
particular,
the
 
case
 
hinged
 
on
 
her
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
sulfur
 
scrubbers
 
for
 
the
 
four
 
OG&E
 
units.
 
In
 
a
 
nutshell,
 
she
 
said
 
that
OG&E
 
at
 
least
 
doubled
 
the
 
cost,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
retrofits
 
look
 
less
 
cost-effective.
 
  
Here’s
 
the
 
thing:
 
Dr.
 
Phyllis
 
Fox
 
also
 
served
 
as
 
a
 
consultant
 
to
 
EPA
 
in
 
its
 
Regional
 
Haze
 
Federal
 
Implementation
 
Plan
for
 
New
 
Mexico.
 
Her
 
role
 
in
 
that
 
action
 
was
 
identical.
 
She
 
performed
 
an
 
analysis
 
of
 
PNM’s
 
cost
 
estimate
 
for
 
a
technology
 
known
 
as
 
selective
 
catalytic
 
reduction.
 
PNM
 
estimated
 
the
 
retrofit
 
cost
 
$730
 
million;
 
Dr.
 
Phyllis
 
Fox
claimed
 
it
 
cost
 
$340
 
million.
 
And
 
based
 
on
 
this,
 
EPA
 
disapproved
 
New
 
Mexico’s
 
plan
 
and
 
imposed
 
a
 
Regional
 
Haze
FIP.
 
PNM
 
subsequently
 
solicited
 
bids
 
to
 
actually
 
build
 
the
 
technology.
 
The
 
utility
 
received
 
two
 
bids,
 
and
 
the
 
cheapest
was
 
$750
 
million!
 
See:
 
http://www.pnm.com/news/2012/0130_scr_rfp.htm
 
.
 
The
 
upshot
 
is
 
that
 
Dr.
 
Phyllis
 
Fox

the

of
 
the
 
10
th
 
Court’s

is
 
Dr.
 
Fox’s
 
credibility.
 
If
 
she’s

on
 
the
 
same

in
 
the

timeframe,
 
then
 
it
 
matter.
 
Accordingly,
 
I

this

usefully

Hi
 
Matt,
 
I’ve
 
an
 
important
 
question:
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
anyone
 
on
 
Scott
 
Pruitt’s
 
team?
 
I
 
ask
 
b/c
 
I’ve
information
 
that
 
perhaps
 
they
 
were
 
unaware
 
of,
 
and
 
which
 
I
 
believe
 
would
 
help
 
their
en
 
banc
 
appeal.
 
I
 
explain
 
below.
 
The
 
majority
 
opinion’s
 
logic
 
rested
 
almost
 
entirely
 
on
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
EPA’s
consultant,
 
Dr.
 
Phyllis
 
Fox.
 
In
 
particular,
 
the
 
case
 
hinged
 
on
 
her
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
cost
 
of
sulfur
 
scrubbers
 
for
 
the
 
four
 
OG&E
 
units.
 
In
 
a
 
nutshell,
 
she
 
said
 
that
 
OG&E
 
at
 
least
doubled
 
the
 
cost,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
retrofits
 
look
 
less
 
cost-effective.
 
Here’s
 
the
 
thing:
 
Dr.
 
Phyllis
 
Fox
 
also
 
served
 
as
 
a
 
consultant
 
to
 
EPA
 
in
 
its
 
Regional
 
Haze
Federal
 
Implementation
 
Plan
 
for
 
New
 
Mexico.
 
Her
 
role
 
in
 
that
 
action
 
was
 
identical.
 
She
performed
 
an
 
analysis
 
of
 
PNM’s
 
cost
 
estimate
 
for
 
a
 
technology
 
known
 
as
 
selective
catalytic
 
reduction.
 
PNM
 
estimated
 
the
 
retrofit
 
cost
 
$730
 
million;
 
Dr.
 
Phyllis
 
Fox
claimed
 
it
 
cost
 
$340
 
million.
 
And
 
based
 
on
 
this,
 
EPA
 
disapproved
 
New
 
Mexico’s
 
plan
and
 
imposed
 
a
 
Regional
 
Haze
 
FIP.
 
PNM
 
subsequently
 
solicited
 
bids
 
to
 
actually
 
build
 
the
technology.
 
The
 
utility
 
received
 
two
 
bids,
 
and
 
the
 
cheapest
 
was
 
$750
 
million!
 
See:
http://www.pnm.com/news/2012/0130_scr_rfp.htm
 
.
 
The
 
upshot
 
is
 
that
 
Dr.
 
Phyllis
 
Fox
has
 
been
 
proven
 
demonstrably
 
wrong.
 
Again,
 
the
 
entire
 
basis
 
of
 
the
 
10
th
 
Court’s
decision
 
is
 
Dr.
 
Fox’s
 
credibility.
 
If
 
she’s
 
been
 
proven
 
wrong
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
matter
 
in
 
the
Feb-17-2017 004285
same timeframe, then it matter. Accordingly, I believe this information might usefully
be
 
incorporated
 
into
 
the

Please see the attached, proposed joint-release to go today,
if possible.
I would suggest the joint release from both offices and AFPF to go sometime today, probably in the early afternoon to afford time for approval from your respective offices.Once the release goes out, would you all be able to post on social media and send to your respective email lists? We will do the same.
I believe a joint release would maximize the effectiveness and help to drive the crowd, coming from both offices and AFPF.
Thoughts on that? Please let us know let us know if you have any edits or any questions.
Thanks!

Subject:"EPA Regulation and Your Pocketbook" - Thursday, Aug 22nd 10-11:30amDate:08/14/2013 03:57 PMImportance:HighAaron and Todd:Firstly, thank you to your respective bosses and all they are doing to push back against President Obama's 
EPA and its axis 
with liberal environmental groups to increase energy costs for Oklahomans and American
families across the states. 
You both work for true champions of freedom and liberty!
I wanted to send a brief rundown of the format for next Thursday's AFP Foundation-OK Community Forum: 
"EPA Regulations and Your Pocketbook." 
I have copied John Tidwell and Josh Harlow w/ Jones PR in OKC
 since they contract with us for PR in multiple mediums.WHEN: August 22nd 10am-11:30am
WHAT: “EPA Regulations and Your Pocketbook” - Panel Discussion and Q&A
WHO: Congressman James Lankford
 OK Attorney General Scott Pruitt
William Yeatman, Asst Director of the Center for Energy & Environment
at the Competitive
 Enterprise Institute (CEI).
 WHERE: Oklahoma City University Meinders School of Business
 2501 N. Blackwelder Ave (corner of 24
th and McKinley)
 OKC, OK 73106
FORMAT / CONTENTThis is an AFP Foundation-OK event (501c3) so there will not be any calls to action of any sort and will strictly be an issue education event for your constituents to come and learn about the great work your bosses are doing to push back against the EPA in Congress and in court and 
how these overly
aggressive
tactics and regulation will hurt the pocketbooks of Oklahomans.
The top-down, overly burdensome regulatory takeovers from the Obama EPA truly do
threaten
Oklahoma families and businesses by pursuing an ideological agenda that results in
 increases in utility rates and cost of doing business.My goal is for this to not only be an event that helps AFP/AFPF-OK but one that helps the Congressman and the AG both from a PR and policy perspective.
CONGRESSMAN LANKFORD
Feb-17-2017 004302
The Congressman can discuss his bill on Sue and Settle, his EPA committee business on House Govt
Oversight. 
The idea is to discuss how Sue and Settle works to execute the President's
ideological environmental agenda by circumventing Congressional
authority. 
Also, perhaps
discuss all that the
Congressman
has done on Regional Haze within the
SUe and Settle context
—strictly aesthetic regulation et al. 
If he wants to discuss the situation that RH regulations has
 put OK utilities into he is certainly welcome to do that as well with out specific discussion of the PSO/EPA settlement.
ACTION ITEMS
-If you can provide some info (talking points, bullet points, et al) re: Lankford's Sue and Settle bill and additional items he would like to discuss within the vein above, we can put those talkers into a few power point slides and handouts for each attendee.ATTORNEY GENERAL PRUITTThis is an excellent opportunity for the AG to discuss the role of attorneys general as a last line of defense for states rights against overly intrusive federal regulation of which EPA environmental is only one example.
More specifically, the AG can discuss the specifics of his new Sue and Settle litigation, its merits, context, etc so as to explain how the states are pushing back against the President's environmental agenda through the 
rule of law. 
If the AG would like to discuss his involvement in seeking dismissal of the PSO Environmental
Compliance case at the OCC, he is certainly more than welcome to do so. 
I understand if he does not wish
 to.
ACTION ITEMS
-Please provide some talking points, bullet points et al. re Pruitt's Sue and Settle litigation, its importance 
and any other point the AG would like to discuss within the vein above. 
We will put into PPT slides and
 handouts for all attendees.WILL YEATMAN (CEI)Yeatman is with the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) in DC and is the Asst Director of CEIs Center for 
Energy and Environment.
Yeatman was retained several months ago by AFP Foundation-OK to perform a
study of the manner EPA has conducted itself in the states, including Oklahoma. 
This study will include a
 comprehensive cost analysis of the Revised State Implementation Plan (SIP) on Regional Haze compliance.
This will include analysis of the costs of the EPA/PSO settlement and projected costs to ratepayers.
Yeatman will present the study in a brief PPT presentation at the event after each of you have had the 
opportunity to speak. 
I will provide both of your offices an advance copy of the study. 
The idea here is for
 an objective third party think tank fellow to discuss PSO/EPA settlement and you will not be asked to comment specifically.Q&A
The panel discussion will be followed by Q&A from the attendees. 
Again, the session is scheduled to run
 from 10am-11:30am total.
Feb-17-2017 004303
MEDIAWe will have media in attendance and, if each of your offices is comfortable, we would like to tape the panel session and edit for YouTube to disseminate to our membership who are unable to attend the event.
If this is a problem please let myself or John Tidwell know.Thanks for all you guys do,Matt BallState DirectorAFP Foundation/Americans for Prosperity-Oklahoma(405) 315-3668 mobileMball@afphq.org

Subject:Bullet points from AG PruittDate:08/21/2013 11:07 AM
Here are some bullet points from the AG's office on "sue and settle." 
Let me know if you have questions,
AC. 12 states - led by Oklahoma - seeking documents from the EPA under theFreedom of Information Act related to “sue and settle.” The tactic is employed by the EPA as a way to settle lawsuits withenvironmental organizations, including Greenpeace, Defenders of Wildlife,WildEarth Guardians and the Sierra Club, without allowing stateinvolvement. In some instances, the EPA entered a consent decree the same day alawsuit was filed by the special interest group, suggesting prior knowledge.The agreements between the EPA and environmental groups have led tonew rules and regulations for states without allowing attorneys general toenter the process to defend the interest of states, businesses andconsumers. Out of the 45 settlements made public, the EPA has paid nearly $1 millionin attorneys’ fees to the environmental groups, while also committing todevelop sweeping new regulations. One EPA consent decree led to theEPA’s costliest regulation ever – the Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS). Under the Clean Air Act, the states – not the EPA – design and implementplans for compliance with the Regional Haze program. States’ alsorequested a fee waiver. CEI found that 92 percent of the time EPA grants fee waiver requests fromnoncommercial requesters who are supportive of EPA’s policies andagendas, but denies a majority of fee waiver requests from noncommercialrequesters who are critical of EPA.

 Has the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) colluded with some of theleft's favorite environmental groups in an effort to skirt state policymakers andpass some of the strictest environmental regulations to date? OklahomaAttorney General Scott Pruitt and 11 of his colleagues have been asking theEPA that question for months. However, they have been continually deniedanswers despite complying with Freedom of Information Act guidelines. 
 Pruitt is leading a multistate effort to push back against what he alleges is theEPA's latest encroachment on the Constitution - a legal gimmick known as"sue and settle."

Attorney General Scott Pruitt battling EPA's environmental
cronyism
By James Hall 
Has the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) colluded with some of theleft's favorite environmental groups in an effort to skirt state policymakers andpass some of the strictest environmental regulations to date? OklahomaAttorney General Scott Pruitt and 11 of his colleagues have been asking theEPA that question for months. However, they have been continually deniedanswers despite complying with Freedom of Information Act guidelines.
Pruitt is leading a multistate effort to push back against what he alleges is theEPA's latest encroachment on the Constitution - a legal gimmick known as"sue and settle."

Melissa:  Atttached is Baxter's resume.  I just thought he might be a good fit for you guys.  He is very sharp, personable, and a talented writer.  We are enjoying him here at OCPA and while I don't want to lose him, I know he is looking for more of a challenge.  He is very interested in politics and policy and is willing to learn.He came highly recommended from Josie Freede, and he is very conservative.  I'd be happy to arrange lunch.  ( I also think he could be helpful on the campaign side of things)

Oklahoma Attorney General Wins First Battle in Challenge to Implementationof Obamacare OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt Monday won the state’s firstchallenge against the Affordable Care Act after a federal judge denied the government’smotion to dismiss the case. Judge Ronald White issued the decision Monday afternoon in the U.S. District Court for theEastern District of Oklahoma in Muskogee. “The court rejected the federal government’s argument that Oklahoma lacked standing tochallenge the law, allowing us to proceed with this pivotal case,” General Pruitt said. “We’reoptimistic the court will recognize what states have known for months that the IRSdisregarded the law by making the large employer mandate effective in Oklahoma or in any ofthe 33 other states without a state health care exchange.” Oklahoma challenged implementation of the Affordable Care Act after the IRS finalized a rulethat would allow the federal government to punish “large employers,” including localgovernment, with millions of dollars in tax penalties in states without state health careexchanges, which is not allowed under the health care law. “Congress provided a choice for Oklahoma and other states in implementation of the healthcare law, and the IRS is attempting to take that away by rule,” General Pruitt said. “Theadministration miscalculated how many states would support this law, so now they’re usingthe IRS to push through provisions that Congress did not pass.” Oklahoma’s original lawsuit was filed in January 2011. In September, following the U.S.Supreme Court decision, General Pruitt filed an amended complaint to raise issues related tothe law’s implementation. ###

Subject:Summary: Oklahoma Medicaid expansion voter surveyDate:08/29/2013 04:13 PMRecently, OCPA hosted a series of conference calls that served as an overview of public opinion datafrom a recent survey of 865 likely Oklahoma voters. The subject of the survey was the ObamacareMedicaid expansion, which Gov. Fallin has prudently rejected for Oklahoma, but which some groupsare still pushing for.
Below please find a summary of the key findings from the survey and links to download PDFs of thefull survey data. Please let us know if OCPA can provide follow-up info on this or any other aspect ofthe Obamacare Medicaid expansion debate.

Oklahoma voters show wariness of Obamacare
Medicaid expansion
BY OCPA

THU, AUG 15, 2013 07:00 AM CDT
OKLAHOMA
AND
MEDICAID
Feb-17-2017 004349
With the Obamacare Medicaid expansion currently a hot topic of conversation, thenonpartisan
Liberty Foundation of America
has commissioned broad surveys in a number of states togauge voter opinion on the subject,
including one in Oklahoma this past May
. That survey polled865 likely general election voters and had a margin of error at +/- 3.33 percent.
The resulting data provide insight into the Oklahoma electorate’s views on the expansion ofMedicaid as allowed in the federal Obamacare law. When considering these results, it is worthnoting that Oklahoma has seen every county vote for the Republican nominee in each of the pastthree presidential election cycles. Also, every statewide elected office is now held by a Republican,and both houses of the state Legislature feature super-majority Republican control.Some highlights from the survey:(1) The partisan split between Republicans and Democrats is enormous on Medicaid expansion, withRepublican voters strongly opposed to the expansion and Democrats in favor. Independent voters aresomewhat split on this issue.(2) Among all voters (AAV), 52 percent think it is time to give some new candidates a chance inoffice in the upcoming 2014 election cycle.(3) AAV, a plurality of voters (47 percent) believe that Medicaid is a “flawed program that wastes alot of money, has problems of fraud and abuse, and is in severe need of reform.” As noted below,this is a strong argument in the minds of Oklahoma voters against expansion of Medicaid. In thecross-tabulations (Table 4-1), 67.4 percent of Republicans hold this belief along with 45.2 percent ofIndependents.(4) AAV, Medicaid expansion is opposed by a 46.2 percent to 41.9 percent plurality. In the cross-tabulations (Table 5-1), 66.2 percent of Republicans hold this belief along with 45.2 percent ofIndependents.(5) When the wide variance in the estimated number of Medicaid enrollees (and associated taxpayercosts) as a result of expansion is considered, a near-majority of voters oppose Medicaid expansion at
Feb-17-2017 004350
49 percent. In the cross-tabulations (Table 6-1), 69.4 percent of Republicans hold this view along
with 41 percent of Independents. Again, as noted below, this is another strong argument in the mindsof many voters against expansion. The Ohio Speaker of the House specifically cited this variance asthe reason the Ohio House of Representatives rejected Medicaid expansion.(6) Regarding the seven messaging questions tested, top pollsters will tell you that any percentageabove 40 percent who find an argument "very compelling" is the gold standard because when"somewhat compelling" voters are added, you easily surpass the 50 percent threshold. AAV, fivearguments against Medicaid expansion polled very strongly. Namely, more than 40 percent AAVfound these arguments “very compelling”:·
54%: Medicaid should not be expanded until the waste, fraud, and abuse in the program is
cleaned up;

49%: Because there is so much disagreement among experts on the costs of expandingMedicaid, we shouldn’t rush into any expansion until we have a better handle on thefinancial consequences;·
44%: We can’t count on the debt-ridden federal government’s contribution to OklahomaMedicaid to last forever, so in the future Oklahoma taxpayers will be left to foot the bill forall the new Medicaid recipients added;·
42%: Expanding Medicaid would allow too many able-bodied young people to getinsurance, even if they just choose not to work to provide for their own healthcare needs;and·
41%: Expanding Medicaid would just give the federal government more power and control
over our lives.
With that same set of questions, the cross-tabulation findings are the key to interpreting the surveyresults. Of the seven arguments, two polled very high among Republican voters and Independentvoters, with another two arguments grabbing a solid group of Independent voters. The specific
findings are in Tables 7-1, 8-1, 9-1, 10-1, 11-1, 12-1, and 13-1. 
(Click on chart to enlarge)Policymakers across the country in states like Ohio, Florida, South Carolina, and elsewhere arereceiving strong pushback from their Republican voting bases when the issue of Obamacare’sMedicaid expansion is considered. 
The results of the Liberty Foundation survey suggest the same
dynamic likely exists in Oklahoma
.
Legislators and statewide elected officials are finding that
when they hold an open and honest

conversation with their constituents about the many factors involved with Obamacare’s expansion of
Medicaid, their constituents are often opposed to expansion
. In Oklahoma, the survey data suggestthat the voting base of Republican elected officials is unequivocally against expansion, andunaffiliated voters break toward rejecting expansion when details are provided.

slide presentation
and the
cross-tabulations
from the
Magellan Strategies survey.

RE: VIDEO for SPN Oklahoma "Big Ideas" nightHi Diane,
 We can definitely record at the AG’s office. The actual filming with Gen. Pruitt shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.I will probably come early to set up. As you can see from the draft below, each appearance is pretty short. We wouldlike him to say something along the lines of “I fight for federalism because I believe in big ideas.” But we welcomefeedback from your team…would you like to tweak the sentence or add to it? The idea is that each personcommunicates one big idea that elevates our state.
 As for scheduling, we are trying to have all pieces recorded by August 15th.
 Thanks for your help!

 Hi Dacia,
We are working with General's Pruitt's executive assistant to schedule the video tapping for the Big Ideasvideo. How long will General Pruitt's segment be and how long do you think we need to record?
Also, it lists his location as the Capitol, but I think General Pruitt would rather do it here at the AG's Office-- 313 NE 21 (just SW of the Capitol).

RE: VIDEO for SPN Oklahoma "Big Ideas" night
Hi Diane,
We can definitely record at the AG’s office. The actual filming with Gen. Pruitt shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.I will probably come early to set up. As you can see from the draft below, each appearance is pretty short. We wouldlike him to say something along the lines of “I fight for federalism because I believe in big ideas.” But we welcomefeedback from your team…would you like to tweak the sentence or add to it? The idea is that each personcommunicates one big idea that elevates our state.
As for scheduling, we are trying to have all pieces recorded by August 15th.
Thanks for your help!

Hi Dacia,
We are working with General's Pruitt's executive assistant to schedule the video tapping for the Big Ideasvideo. How long will General Pruitt's segment be and how long do you think we need to record?
Also, it lists his location as the Capitol, but I think General Pruitt would rather do it here at the AG's Office-- 313 NE 21 (just SW of the Capitol).

Subject:RE: VIDEO for SPN Oklahoma "Big Ideas" nightDate:07/30/2013 03:19 PMHi Diane,
We can definitely record at the AG’s office. The actual filming with Gen. Pruitt shouldn’t take morethan 30 minutes. I will probably come early to set up. As you can see from the draft below, eachappearance is pretty short. We would like him to say something along the lines of “I fight forfederalism because I believe in big ideas.” But we welcome feedback from your team…would you like to tweak thesentence or add to it? The idea is that each person communicates one big idea that elevates our state.
As for scheduling, we are trying to have all pieces recorded by August 15th.
Thanks for your help!

We are working with General's Pruitt's executive assistant to schedule the video tapping for the Big Ideasvideo. How long will General Pruitt's segment be and how long do you think we need to record?
Also, it lists his location as the Capitol, but I think General Pruitt would rather do it here at the AG's Office-- 313 NE 21 (just SW of the Capitol).

Subject:Re: Oct. 3 School Choice CoalitionDate:09/30/2013 04:21 PMThanks Baxter. Appreciate the invite!
Mr Price, unfortunately I was unable to move my flight to Asheville, NC on Thursday, but would love to come back at some later date and present our findings to the Coalition. My time in other states developing model legislation and conducting state assessments is at the core of what I do in this new position.
Please keep me informed on where Oklahoma is heading on parental choice. It IS for the kids!StuartStuart JollyExecutive Political DirectorEducation Freedom Alliance405.514.0514S.jolly@EduFreedom.orgFrom: Baxter Lewallen <

'
Gridlock is not an American
problem. It is an American
achievement'
Forward the cause:
The U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down a part of the federal Defenseof Marriage Act (DOMA) that made it illegal for the federal government totreat marriage solely as the union of one man and one woman - legallyreferred to as Part 3 of DOMA. The Court's ruling, however, left firmly inplace Part 2 of DOMA which says that the states are the final arbiter of howmarriage is treated. The ruling did not implement so-called same-sexmarriage (SSM) in 35 states where it is banned by statute or constitutionalprovision.
Despite the narrow ruling from the Supreme Court, President Obama isdetermined to undermine these 35 states through the use of federalexecutive power. President Obama bluntly stated that "It's my personalbelief - but I'm speaking now as a president as opposed to as a lawyer - thatif you've married in Massachusetts and you move someplace else, you'restill married, and that under federal law you should be able to obtain thebenefits of any lawfully married couple."

Forward the cause:
Whatever one thinks of the current partial-government shutdown,conservatives in Washington should be applauded for trying to protect
Americans from Obamacare. As Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal
put it,"Obamacare is bad for the country. We would like to see it repealed andreplaced, not to score political points, but to save our nation's health carefrom higher costs and lesser care. We appreciate all the Republicans inWashington fighting to do just that." Gov. Jindal is chairman of theRepublican Governors Association, which has declined to denounce theshutdown.
The current shutdown serves as one more reminder that Oklahoma House
Speaker T. W. Shannon was
wise
to try to plan for scenarios in which state
agencies lose federal funding. Unfortunately, Speaker Shannon's effortswere not successful. Now our state government is put in the position of
having to
react
, as journalist Patrick McGuigan
points out, "rather than to actafter forethought and preparation."

"There's a tradition in education," former New York City schools chancellorFrank Macchiarola once observed, "that if you spend a dollar and it doesn'twork, you should spend two dollars; and not only that, you should give thosetwo dollars to the same person who couldn't do the job with only one."
That tradition is alive and well in Oklahoma. Earlier this year the
TulsaWorld
reported
that national education activist Jonah Edelman, founder and
chief executive officer of Stand for Children, was in Tulsa to announce thathis organization is launching an affiliate in Oklahoma. "If Oklahoma wants toget results for students, it needs to fund the reforms it has already passed,"Edelman said. One example he cited was a recent reform of the ReadingSufficiency Act.

"There's a tradition in education," former New York City schools chancellorFrank Macchiarola once observed, "that if you spend a dollar and it doesn'twork, you should spend two dollars; and not only that, you should give thosetwo dollars to the same person who couldn't do the job with only one."
That tradition is alive and well in Oklahoma. Earlier this year the
TulsaWorld
reported
that national education activist Jonah Edelman, founder and
chief executive officer of Stand for Children, was in Tulsa to announce thathis organization is launching an affiliate in Oklahoma. "If Oklahoma wants toget results for students, it needs to fund the reforms it has already passed,"Edelman said. One example he cited was a recent reform of the ReadingSufficiency Act.

According to a study by two Oklahoma sociologists, children living withmarried parents are significantly more likely to have private health-careinsurance than are their peers whose biological parents are notmarried.
Loretta Bass of the University of Oklahoma and Nicole Warehime ofOklahoma Baptist University examined data of the Fragile Families andChild Well-being Study, measuring the relationship between familystructure and child health outcomes at age 5. The researchers lookedat data - collected for children born to 1,186 married mothers and3,712 unmarried mothers between 1988 and 2000 - to explore theeffects of parental marital status on three measures: the child's healthinsurance type, the child's having a routine medical doctor, and thechild's being reported in excellent health.

It seems almost weekly that we hear about more intrusion by federalgovernment agencies, such as the NSA, into the lives of citizens who are
supposed to be free. When the government secretly
invades the privacy oflaw-abiding citizens
, attempts to
intimidate the assembling of organizationslike OCPA and ALEC
, and uses the IRS to target those who
don't agree
with
President Barack Obama, reflection upon the words of 
the founding fathers
is imperative.
Thomas Jefferson said: "My reading of history convinces me that most badgovernment results from too much government."Jefferson provided thisvision for the proper role of government: "A wise and frugal Governmentshall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise freeto regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall nottake from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum ofgood government."

Dr. Coburn, OCPA warn against Medicaid expansion - in any

By OCPA

Oklahoma
Parental choice preferable
to increased government
spending
Forward the cause:
Former OCPA trustee Dr. Tom Coburn and current OCPA fiscal policydirector Jonathan Small have been two of the leading voices in Oklahomawarning against the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. In a column published
yesterday in the
Tulsa World, they make the argument that policymakersshould continue to oppose expanding Medicaid - in any form.
"The lessons of history and the hard numbers are clear: It is not fiscallyresponsible or wise to expand a strained entitlement program and rely onfederal funding that is unlikely," Coburn and Small write. "While it has beentempting for some consultants and lawmakers to try to dress up Medicaidexpansion as 'program redesign,' it is simply not in our state's long-terminterest to expand Medicaid, whether that's under the guise of additional
federal funding or creative program designs.
Given the economic facts, any
expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would be a step in thewrong direction."

RE: VIDEO for SPN Oklahoma "Big Ideas" night Hi Diane, 
 We can definitely record at the AG’s office. The actual filming with Gen. Pruitt shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.I will probably come early to set up. As you can see from the draft below, each appearance is pretty short. We wouldlike him to say something along the lines of “I fight for federalism because I believe in big ideas.” But we welcomefeedback from your team…would you like to tweak the sentence or add to it? The idea is that each personcommunicates one big idea that elevates our state. 
 As for scheduling, we are trying to have all pieces recorded by August 15th. 
 Thanks for your help!

We are working with General's Pruitt's executive assistant to schedule the video tapping for the Big Ideasvideo. How long will General Pruitt's segment be and how long do you think we need to record?
Also, it lists his location as the Capitol, but I think General Pruitt would rather do it here at the AG's Office-- 313 NE 21 (just SW of the Capitol).

dinner this year) recently
reminded
Oklahoma policymakers how important it
is to resist this harmful law. Now Sen. DeMint has penned

Dear Mr. President:
As the temporary slowdown in government operations enters itssecond week, I write to explain why conservatives have insisted onmaking the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act the primesource of contention. Speaking for our organization, I can tell you we'rein this fight because of the harm the law is inflicting on Americansacross the country.

Shawnee Middle School principal Brent Houston is encouraged by somesmall improvements in the scores of 9- and 13-year-olds, but acknowledgesthat they don't last.

Subject:Greetings from the Attorney General's OfficeDate:07/16/2013 11:32 AM
Greetings all. 
I hope this message finds you doing well. 
I'm writing to let you know about a couple of
items. 
First, as you can tell by this e-mail message, I am now with the AG's office. 
This week I began my new
job as director of public affairs at the attorney general's office. 
The governor and her staff were gracious
in wishing me well in this new endeavor; meanwhile, the AG and his staff have been great in welcoming
me to the team. 
In addition to press-related duties, I'll be working on community relations, public affairs
outreach and strategic communications strategy. 
I'm looking forward to this new opportunity.
Hopefully, we can find ways for OCPA and the AG's office to work together. 
Which brings me to the next
item of business. 
I wanted to bring to your attention a great piece from Fred Barnes in 
The WeeklyStandard, about the efforts of AG Pruitt and other Republican AG's to challenge the Obama
administration agenda. 
You can find the article here:

 Here's a clip: Practically no one has noticed the emergence of the Republican AGs. Yet they’re ascourge of President Obama. They drive the Environmental Protection Agency crazy.They’ve beaten the best lawyers at the Justice Department numerous times. “What Ireally do for fun is I go into the office [and] I sue the Obama administration,” Texasattorney general Greg Abbott said last year. He’s filed 30 lawsuits against theadministration, 17 against EPA alone—with considerable success.The AGs, who often attack the administration in packs, have done more thanRepublicans in Congress, statehouses, or anywhere else to block, cripple, undermine,or weaken Obama’s initiatives. They failed to stop Obamacare in the Supreme Court,but won limits on Medicaid and neutralized the use of the commerce clause toexpand the reach of the federal government. And there’s one case left. AG ScottPruitt of Oklahoma has sued to prevent Obama-run health insurance exchanges fromhanding out subsidies. If he wins—and he has a credible case—the implementation ofObamacare will come to a halt, at least temporarily. ...Scott Pruitt, 45, was a state senator and co-owner of the Oklahoma RedHawks Triple-A baseball team before his election as AG. He took the lead in suing the federalgovernment over the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill on the ground that itjeopardizes state pension funds. Ten AGs have joined the suit. He and Abbottsucceeded in voiding a dubious EPA rule that claimed air pollution from Texas andOklahoma was harming Granite City, Illinois.Pruitt never refers to the Affordable Care Act as Obamacare because he doesn’t wantto “politicize” an issue that, for him, is about the rule of law and the federalgovernment’s exceeding its authority. But he takes a sharply critical view of Obama.“He’s kept his promise that Washington knows best,” Pruitt says. “He’s kept hispromise that if Congress doesn’t [act], he can’t wait. The only thing wrong with thatis it’s not consistent with our Constitution and our rule of law. He can’t do that. Whoelse but a state attorney general is in a position to respond?

Here's a clip:
Practically
no
one
has
noticed
the
emergence
of
the
Republican
AGs.
Yet
they’re
a
scourge
of
President
Obama.
They
drive
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
crazy.
They’ve
beaten
the
best
lawyers
at
the
Justice
Department
numerous
times.
“What
I
really
do
for
fun
is
I
go
into
the
office
[and]
I
sue
the
Obama
administration,”
Texas
attorney
general
Greg
Abbott
said
last
year.
He’s
filed
30
lawsuits
against
the
administration,
17
against
EPA
alone—with
considerable
success.
The
AGs,
who
often
attack
the
administration
in
packs,
have
done
more
than
Republicans
in
Congress,
statehouses,
or
anywhere
else
to
block,
cripple,
undermine,
or
weaken
Obama’s
initiatives.
They
failed
to
stop
Obamacare
in
the
Supreme
Court,
but
won
limits
on
Medicaid
Feb-17-2017 004505
and neutralized the use of the commerce clause to expand the reach of the federal government.
And
there’s
one
case
left.
AG
Scott
Pruitt
of
Oklahoma
has
sued
to
prevent
Obama-run
health
insurance
exchanges
from
handing
out
subsidies.
If
he
wins—and
he
has
a
credible
case—the
implementation
of
Obamacare
will
come
to
a
halt,
at
least
temporarily.
...
Scott
Pruitt,
45,
was
a
state
senator
and
co-owner
of
the
Oklahoma
RedHawks
Triple-A
baseball
team
before
his
election
as
AG.
He
took
the
lead
in
suing
the
federal
government
over
the
Dodd-Frank
financial
reform
bill
on
the
ground
that
it
jeopardizes
state
pension
funds.
Ten
AGs
have
joined
the
suit.
He
and
Abbott
succeeded
in
voiding
a
dubious
EPA
rule
that
claimed
air
pollution
from
Texas
and
Oklahoma
was
harming
Granite
City,
Illinois.
Pruitt
never
refers
to
the
Affordable
Care
Act
as
Obamacare
because
he
doesn’t
want
to
“politicize”
an
issue
that,
for
him,
is
about
the
rule
of
law
and
the
federal
government’s
exceeding
its
authority.
But
he
takes
a
sharply
critical
view
of
Obama.
“He’s
kept
his
promise
that
Washington
knows
best,”
Pruitt
says.
“He’s
kept
his
promise
that
if
Congress
doesn’t
[act],
he
can’t
wait.
The
only
thing
wrong
with
that
is
it’s
not
consistent
with
our
Constitution
and
our
rule
of
law.
He
can’t
do
that.
Who
else
but
a
state
attorney
general
is
in
a
position
to
respond?
Who
else
is
there
but
a
state
AG
to
stand
up
and
say
no?”
Pruitt
likes
his
job.
He
is
the
chairman
of
the
Republican
Attorneys
General
Association.
It's a great story and one I thought OCPA would possibly want to share via blog, social media or otheravenues of communication.
Thanks for the consideration and please let me know if I can be of assistance to you.

Oklahoma's transparency trend
By Michael Carnuccio
Several years ago Sen. Tom Coburn teamed up with then-Sen.Barack Obama to pass a law creating a searchable Internetdatabase to track the recipients of all federal funds.
Feb-17-2017 004513
Shortly thereafter, Coburn teamed up with my colleague Brandon Dutcher to penan op-ed recommending that Oklahoma's state government do the same thing.
The idea proved to be popular - a bill passed unanimously, as I recall - and shortlythereafter Oklahoma's "Open Books" website was born. The idea soon spread toother states.
As much as I salute government transparency efforts, I think it's even better whenthe private sector embraces transparency. And here too, Oklahomans appear to bestarting a trend.

Subject:Weekly Standard article on AG PruittDate:07/17/2013 05:11 PMDacia, 
Thought this might be a good story for OCPA to share on Twitter and Facebook. 
It's about the work of
AG Pruitt and other Repubican AGs to push back against the Obama administration agenda. Here is the link to the story and a couple of highlights 
http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/last-
redoubt_739263.html?page=1
: Practically no one has noticed the emergence of the Republican AGs. Yet they’re ascourge of President Obama. They drive the Environmental Protection Agency crazy.They’ve beaten the best lawyers at the Justice Department numerous times. “What Ireally do for fun is I go into the office [and] I sue the Obama administration,” Texasattorney general Greg Abbott said last year. He’s filed 30 lawsuits against theadministration, 17 against EPA alone—with considerable success.The AGs, who often attack the administration in packs, have done more thanRepublicans in Congress, statehouses, or anywhere else to block, cripple, undermine,or weaken Obama’s initiatives. They failed to stop Obamacare in the Supreme Court,but won limits on Medicaid and neutralized the use of the commerce clause toexpand the reach of the federal government. And there’s one case left. AG ScottPruitt of Oklahoma has sued to prevent Obama-run health insurance exchanges fromhanding out subsidies. If he wins—and he has a credible case—the implementation ofObamacare will come to a halt, at least temporarily. ...Scott Pruitt, 45, was a state senator and co-owner of the Oklahoma RedHawks Triple-A baseball team before his election as AG. He took the lead in suing the federalgovernment over the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill on the ground that itjeopardizes state pension funds. Ten AGs have joined the suit. He and Abbottsucceeded in voiding a dubious EPA rule that claimed air pollution from Texas andOklahoma was harming Granite City, Illinois.Pruitt never refers to the Affordable Care Act as Obamacare because he doesn’t wantto “politicize” an issue that, for him, is about the rule of law and the federalgovernment’s exceeding its authority. But he takes a sharply critical view of Obama.“He’s kept his promise that Washington knows best,” Pruitt says. “He’s kept hispromise that if Congress doesn’t [act], he can’t wait. The only thing wrong with thatis it’s not consistent with our Constitution and our rule of law. He can’t do that. Whoelse but a state attorney general is in a position to respond? Who else is there but astate AG to stand up and say no?” Pruitt likes his job. He is the chairman of theRepublican Attorneys General Association. Thanks and let me know if I can be of assistance to you.

From 2004 through 2009, Oklahoma's personal income tax - the amount thestate penalizes citizens and job creators for the right to earn a living - waslowered more than 20 percent. Over this period of time, the top marginalrate dropped, in a series of four reductions, from 7.00 percent to 5.50percent.With each drop in the rate, many individuals and organizations in favor ofhigher government spending worked against the income tax cuts. Theyclaimed income tax cuts would result in less revenue for state governmentprograms. Even the Oklahoma Tax Commission estimated, with each newincome tax cut, that the state would see a loss in revenue.

Friends,I would like to invite you to join me for a very special evening on Friday, July 19at 6:30 p.m. on the campus of Oklahoma Christian University, where we willfeature presentations from Four Star Leadership students and a keynote speechfrom my friend Karl Rove. I am confident Mr. Rove will provide a memorableexperience for our students and guests, but I am also certain that you would
personally be inspired and uplifted by spending time with these young people. 
Feb-17-2017 004548
Out of concern for the future of our nation and a desire to build up young
leaders to help direct her steps, my friends and I created the Four StarLeadership program, a world-class summer leadership program that allows 50of the top high school students in the US to have a face-to-face experience withnational and international leaders. I am excited that OCPA is partnering with meto help conduct the program, and I would like to invite you to see just how
special it is. 
This year's class contains students representing 30 different states as well as 2foreign countries and is truly a once in a lifetime experience for these youngpeople as they interact with their peers from around the country and around theworld. During the week, the students learn from outstanding leadership andpolicy experts while also being challenged through hands-on learningexperiences designed to help sharpen their leadership and communicationskills, all while competing for college scholarships. I hope you can join KarlRove, 50 of America's best and brightest young leaders, and me for this unique
event. 
Please see the information below for details or contact OCPA with anyquestions you may have.

They are watching our better-than-average growth and interested in learning whatthe experience has been like, which gives us an opportunity to reflect on what boldleadership has done for our state.
People and businesses vote with their feet. For the seven years before becoming aright-to-work state, Oklahoma's net migration was a loss exceeding 10,000households and more than $1 billion in income to other states.

In 2012, the USDA paid out $14.9 billion in farm subsidies and Oklahomareceiving $382 million. The latest iteration of the farm bill is moving in amore favorable direction of "crop insurance" rather than direct subsidies,although some level of subsidies would remain for some commodities.Unfortunately, this type of insurance is unlike any insurance you and I payfor our car or house. The insurance payments are heavily subsidized and
benefits often flow to large insurance companies.

To boost economic growth, Oklahoma should push back

'
Gridlock is not an American
problem. It is an American
achievement'
Forward the cause:
The U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down a part of the federal Defenseof Marriage Act (DOMA) that made it illegal for the federal government totreat marriage solely as the union of one man and one woman - legallyreferred to as Part 3 of DOMA. The Court's ruling, however, left firmly inplace Part 2 of DOMA which says that the states are the final arbiter of howmarriage is treated. The ruling did not implement so-called same-sexmarriage (SSM) in 35 states where it is banned by statute or constitutionalprovision.
Despite the narrow ruling from the Supreme Court, President Obama isdetermined to undermine these 35 states through the use of federalexecutive power. President Obama bluntly stated that "It's my personalbelief - but I'm speaking now as a president as opposed to as a lawyer - thatif you've married in Massachusetts and you move someplace else, you'restill married, and that under federal law you should be able to obtain thebenefits of any lawfully married couple."

Obamacare continues to fail
Forward the cause:
Obamacare is coming, and one predicted result has been job cuts byemployers who can no longer afford to employ as many workers as
before.
The Wall Street Journal's Stephen Moore recently wondered if thatprediction was true, so he went to a man who should know: Oklahoma's ownBob Funk, a founder and still honcho at Express Employment Services, oneof the nation's largest employment firms.
"Employers are living in a state of fear," Mr. Funk
said
flatly, citing
Obamacare, regulations, and accounting requirements flowing out ofWashington. He said his business is booming precisely because moreemployers are shifting from full-time workers who would have to be coveredwith more expensive health insurance under Obamacare to part-timersprovided by Express. Since Obamacare has set a 50-employee thresholdfor coverage, lots of employers are stopping at 49 full-time workers andasking companies like Express to provide the rest of their workforce.

While the most important issues in health care continue to be thewidespread absence (with notable exceptions) of medical pricetransparency and inappropriate government intrusion into the healthcaresector, Governor Mary Fallin should be commended for obtainingpermission from the Obama Administration to continue the Insure Oklahomaprogram for at least a year - without ceding ground on her pledge to refuseObamacare's Medicaid expansion dollars.-

Key sections of the 2009 law brought clarity tothe liability of producers, manufacturers, and even schools.

Forward the cause:
"To challenge an Oklahoma law providing scholarships to children withspecial needs, plaintiffs in a new lawsuit are embracing government hubris
and paternalism at its worst,"
The Oklahoman
noted yesterday in an
excellent editorial.
Their lawsuit's core argument is this: Government officials know betterhow to care for most children than their parents do.
The lawsuit, filed by 12 individuals in their capacity as private citizens(although six are current or former school administrators), seeks tohave the Lindsey Nicole Henry Scholarships law declaredunconstitutional. The law, in effect since 2010, allows the use of statefunds (already designated for the individual education of children withspecial needs) to be used to pay tuition at a private school.

Subject: OCPA energy conference Brian,
I had a few logistical questions about the upcoming OCPA energy conference.
Who will introduce the AG?
Who will moderate the Q&A session? Will there be a mic in the audience for Q&A?
Any estimate on how large the audience will be? 
What is the make-up of the audience
(energy execs, think-tank professionals, etc)?
Appreciate the assistance in advance.
Thanks,
AC

I am excited about the AG’s presentation, and I am happy to answer your questions.
 Both Mark
Stansberry and I will be serving as masters of ceremony that day, but I will most likely have the
honor of introducing the AG.
 I will also be the Q&A moderator, and we will have a handheld mic for
the audience to ask questions.
 I expect the audience to be approximately 100-150 energy
executives as well as think tank professionals and interested citizens.
Please let me know if you need any other information.

A good portion of the OCPA staff is in Chicago this week for the 40th annualmeeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a nonprofitorganization comprised of state lawmakers and private-sector leaders.ALEC is devoted to the principles of free markets, limited government, andfederalism, which is why several OCPA staffers are ALEC members. (Some,like my colleague Jonathan Small, actually hold key leadership positions inthe organization.) Though some Oklahoma journalists think of ALEC as"controversial," the organization's positions are essentially in line withmajority opinion in Oklahoma. So it makes sense that Gov. Mary Fallin, aformer ALEC Legislator of the Year, is the featured lunch speaker today.

Think tank boss explains
why the Obamacare fight
matters
Forward the cause:
By now most Americans have heard of the epic disasters associated withthe October 1 rollout of the online health care exchanges associated withObamacare. But let's review briefly: the administration, through theDepartment of Health and Human Services, had three years to design andprepare a system that would supposedly match shoppers with a myriad ofhealth insurance plans. That's about 600 workdays (minus weekends andlots of federal holidays) so one would expect a system that would not crashinto rubble.
"It wasn't designed well, it wasn't implemented well, and it looks like nobodytested it," one computer expert told a news agency. Indeed. Meanwhile,HHS Secretary Kathleen Sibelius dashed around rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic, assuring us things would be OK soon.

Think tank boss explains
why the Obamacare fight
matters
Forward the cause:
By now most Americans have heard of the epic disasters associated withthe October 1 rollout of the online health care exchanges associated withObamacare. But let's review briefly: the administration, through theDepartment of Health and Human Services, had three years to design andprepare a system that would supposedly match shoppers with a myriad ofhealth insurance plans. That's about 600 workdays (minus weekends andlots of federal holidays) so one would expect a system that would not crashinto rubble.
"It wasn't designed well, it wasn't implemented well, and it looks like nobodytested it," one computer expert told a news agency. Indeed. Meanwhile,HHS Secretary Kathleen Sibelius dashed around rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic, assuring us things would be OK soon.

But employers can pick up and leave, taking jobs with them.The recently ended fiscal year was profitable for Oklahoma government. Accordingto the state treasurer's office, the state collected $11.3 billion during the period,setting a record for total tax receipts.

Oklahoma voters show wariness of Obamacare Medicaid

With the Obamacare Medicaid expansion currently a hot topic of
conversation, the nonpartisan
Liberty Foundation of America
has
commissioned broad surveys in a number of states to gauge voter opinion
on the subject,
including one in Oklahoma this past May. That survey polled865 likely general election voters and had a margin of error at +/- 3.33percent.
The resulting data provide insight into the Oklahoma electorate's views onthe expansion of Medicaid as allowed in the federal Obamacare law. Whenconsidering these results, it is worth noting that Oklahoma has seen everycounty vote for the Republican nominee in each of the past threepresidential election cycles. Also, every statewide elected office is now heldby a Republican, and both houses of the state Legislature feature super-majority Republican control.

Oklahoma Attorney General Wins First Battle in Challenge to Implementationof ObamacareOKLAHOMA CITY 
–
Oklahoma
Attorney
General
Scott
Pruitt
Monday
won
the
state’s
first
challenge
against
the
Affordable
Care
Act
after
a
federal
judge
denied
the
government’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
case.
Judge
Ronald
White
issued
the
decision
Monday
afternoon
in
the
U.S.
District
Court
for
the
Eastern
District
of
Oklahoma
in
Muskogee.
“The
court
rejected
the
federal
government’s
argument
that
Oklahoma
lacked
standing
to
challenge
the
law,
allowing
us
to
proceed
with
this
pivotal
case,”
General
Pruitt
said.
“We’re
optimistic
the
court
will
recognize
what
states
have
known
for
months
that
the
IRS
disregarded
the
law
by
making
the
large
employer
mandate
effective
in
Oklahoma
or
in
any
of
the
33
other
states
without
a
state
health
care
exchange.”
Oklahoma
challenged
implementation
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
after
the
IRS
finalized
a
rule
that
would
allow
the
federal
government
to
punish
“large
employers,”
including
local
government,
with
millions
of
dollars
in
tax
penalties
in
states
without
state
health
care
exchanges,
which
is
not
allowed
under
the
health
care
law.
“Congress
provided
a
choice
for
Oklahoma
and
other
states
in
implementation
of
the
health
care
law,
and
the
IRS
is
attempting
to
take
that
away
by
rule,”
General
Pruitt
said.
“The
administration
miscalculated
how
many
states
would
support
this
law,
so
now
they’re
using
the
IRS
to
push
through
provisions
that
Congress
did
not
pass.”
Feb-17-2017 004726
Oklahoma’s original lawsuit was filed in January 2011. In September, following the U.S.
Supreme
Court
decision,
General
Pruitt
filed
an
amended
complaint
to
raise
issues
related
to
the
law’s
implementation.

He is very sharp, personable, and a talented
writer. 
We are enjoying him here at OCPA and while I don't want to lose
him, I know he is looking for more of a challenge. 
He is very interested
in politics and policy and is willing to learn.He came highly recommended from Josie Freede, and he is veryconservative.
I'd be happy to arrange lunch. 
( I also think he could be
 helpful on thecampaign side of things)

This month OCPA launched its newest center, the Agricultural Center forMarkets, Policy, and Property Rights. The Center will focus specifically onagriculture policy research and development (with an emphasis onOklahoma), and will also seek free-market solutions to environmentalchallenges - solutions which don't infringe upon Oklahomans' private-property rights. As with OCPA's other centers, this Center will supportOCPA's mission of expanding liberty, limiting government, andstrengthening the free enterprise system.
Professor Jayson Lusk, pictured above in a June 6 appearance on the JohnStossel program, will serve as the Samuel Roberts Noble DistinguishedFellow at OCPA.

More than 20 other states have rejected Medicaid expansion,thereby preventing half a trillion dollars in deficit spending that ourkids and grandkids would have had to pay.
Feb-17-2017 004739
Keep in mind, what began as a $1 billion national entitlement in 1966 is projected
to hit $900 billion by 2020. In terms of future costs, Matt Salo, the executivedirector of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, noted in testimony:"More people show up than you think will show up, and the people that show upare sicker than you expected." Even if the debt-ridden federal government keepsits commitment to fund expansion at 90 percent, Oklahoma's 10-percent share isof an unknown number. That blank check is uncontrollable and unpredictable, nomatter what expansionists say.

 He is very interested in politics and policy and is willing to learn.

Time to eject
By Michael Carnuccio
In 2006, Barack Obama, then a junior senator from Illinois, said
"Raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure."
Of course, since
Feb-17-2017 004750
becoming the CEO of the United States, he has done so many times.
So we narrowly avoided default, again. The significance of this conversation - andjust how close we are continuing to get to the brink - should have us removingevery current officeholder in our nation's Capitol. A mountainous economic disasteris being administered by people who are unqualified and incapable of leadership.They are too occupied with a popularity crisis.
Someone should tell them the prettiest girl on the Titanic still died.

We can expand access to other educational options, including charterschools, voucher schools, tax-credit schools, ESAs, digital schooling,home-schooling, and hybrid schools. We can also expand access toenriching non-school activities, like museums, theaters, historical sites,summer camps, and after-school programs. Reformers shouldconcentrate their energy on all of these non-traditional-school effortsand stop trying so hard to fix traditional public schools.

Friends,I would like to invite you to join me for a very special evening on Friday, July 19at 6:30 p.m. on the campus of Oklahoma Christian University, where we willfeature presentations from Four Star Leadership students and a keynote speechfrom my friend Karl Rove. I am confident Mr. Rove will provide a memorableexperience for our students and guests, but I am also certain that you would
personally be inspired and uplifted by spending time with these young people.  
Feb-17-2017 004782
Out of concern for the future of our nation and a desire to build up youngleaders to help direct her steps, my friends and I created the Four StarLeadership program, a world-class summer leadership program that allows 50of the top high school students in the US to have a face-to-face experience withnational and international leaders. I am excited that OCPA is partnering with meto help conduct the program, and I would like to invite you to see just how
special it is. 
This year's class contains students representing 30 different states as well as 2foreign countries and is truly a once in a lifetime experience for these youngpeople as they interact with their peers from around the country and around theworld. During the week, the students learn from outstanding leadership andpolicy experts while also being challenged through hands-on learningexperiences designed to help sharpen their leadership and communicationskills, all while competing for college scholarships. I hope you can join KarlRove, 50 of America's best and brightest young leaders, and me for this unique
event. 
Please see the information below for details or contact OCPA with anyquestions you may have.

Proponents of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, whether via premiumassistance or via traditional Medicaid, are using desperate and dishonestarguments to try to persuade Oklahoma policymakers and citizens toexpand Medicaid.
One of the chief falsehoods is that "if Oklahoma doesn't act, our tax dollarswill be sent to other states." This argument demonstrates a complete lack ofunderstanding of the federal/state welfare program known as Medicaid.

a new memo
(a short read, with visuals) detailing
the success of Oklahoma's income tax cuts since 2005.
Couple this with Oklahoma's data from the "How Money Walks" project (seeblog for data). Then the correlation becomes very strong, indeed: as incometax cuts have helped propel Oklahoma's private-sector economy, overall
state tax revenues have risen to record highs.

Please let me know if we can provide follow-up info related to the survey or on the subject ofMedicaid expansion. OCPA will continue to work to drive dialogue about the negative impactsadopting Medicaid expansion would have on Oklahoma. On that note, here are some recent items:

Free Market Friday: Priorities
By Michael Carnuccio
We spend a good amount of time in political conversations aboutthe right direction for our community, state and nation. Most seemto agree that socialism is not a desired pathway for the American dream.
Feb-17-2017 004869
Functional democracies require a different corridor. Rightly so; government owning
and administering the means of production and distribution of goods has neverworked out well for the polity.
Likewise, we spend a lot of time and energy in society exploring for the best waysto provide a quality education. Ironically, the majority of those endeavors involvetrimming the edges of socialism. Whether the state grades our schools or not, westill have socialism. Whether we adopt Common Core standards or not, it's stillsocialism - and that isn't working out well for our children.

Obama Administration

one-year extension
Forward the cause:
"A relieved Gov. Mary Fallin recently announced that the Obamaadministration has agreed to wait a year before euthanizing the Insure
Oklahoma health insurance program,"
OCPA distinguished fellow Andrew
Spiropoulos writes in his latest
Journal Record
column.
So why have the feds given us a reprieve? The administrationperceives an opportunity to use our state's leaders' support of InsureOklahoma as a wedge to break Oklahoma's resistance to the
expansion of Medicaid.
...What's the president's plan? It's very clever.
He will offer to allow us to take all or part of the Medicaid expansionmoney and use it to expand Insure Oklahoma. The pitch is that we cankeep our plan and get the money, too. However, here's the truth - if we
take the deal, it won't be our plan any longer.

Obama administration using Insure Oklahoma to spur
Medicaid expansion
By Brandon Dutcher
Feb-17-2017 004877
Obama Administration
grants Insure Oklahoma
one-year extension
Forward the cause:
"A relieved Gov. Mary Fallin recently announced that the Obamaadministration has agreed to wait a year before euthanizing the Insure
Oklahoma health insurance program,"
OCPA distinguished fellow Andrew
Spiropoulos writes in his latest
Journal Record
column.
So why have the feds given us a reprieve? The administrationperceives an opportunity to use our state's leaders' support of InsureOklahoma as a wedge to break Oklahoma's resistance to the
expansion of Medicaid.
...What's the president's plan? It's very clever.
He will offer to allow us to take all or part of the Medicaid expansionmoney and use it to expand Insure Oklahoma. The pitch is that we cankeep our plan and get the money, too. However, here's the truth - if we
take the deal, it won't be our plan any longer.

Lottery continues to exploit
citizens
Forward the cause:
Virginian Joel Salatin describes himself as a "Christian, libertarian,environmentalist, capitalist farmer
."
Farmer Salatin not only lectures about
farming techniques that boost profit with lower input, he is also a prolificspeaker on the legacy of the family farm. He calls for a shift to the
household economy to increase individual and family freedom.
Salatin operates a family store two hours outside of Washington, D.C.,
where he primarily sells chicken and pork.
Customers must come to him as
he won't throw a chicken in the mail to you.
He is a firm believer in keeping
food and the money that buys the food in the local economy. Twenty yearsago, most of his customers were back-to-the-earth hippies whereas now the
fastest-growing customer segment is the homeschooling family.

Income is flowing out of Oklahoma
By Brandon Dutcher
Feb-17-2017 004909
Oklahoma should push
back against IRS
The great job killer
Forward the cause:
"Economists have long studied migration between the states becausemigration is the ultimate expression of 'voting with your feet,'" OCPAeconomists J. Scott Moody and Wendy P. Warcholik write. "In other words,more people moving into a state is a good sign of social and economicprogress, whereas more people leaving a state is not a good sign."
Over the last two decades Oklahoma has experienced a healthy net in-migration of people. Disturbingly, though, "despite the influx of people,income has been flowing out of Oklahoma - including during a few yearswhen more people moved in than moved out - suggesting that out-migrantshad higher-than-average incomes than in-migrants. Between 1995 and2009, at least $831,553,000 (not adjusted for inflation) left the state."

Will Kim Ki-hoon stand up?
By Michael Carnuccio
The Wall Street Journal
reported that Kim Ki-hoon, a rock-star, 20-
year veteran teacher in South Korea, earns $4 million a year teaching in the
Feb-17-2017 004921
country's private, after-school tutoring academies. He is paid according to the
demand for his skills, unlike most teachers across the globe.
Don't forget, South Korean students rank among the best in the world.
As education economist Andrew Coulsen points out, merit pay may not be as easya solution for Oklahoma. "Offering merit pay to teachers does nothing to liberateprincipals from the shackles of union contracts and state licensing requirementsthat determine whom they can hire and fire. Neither does it give principals theincentives enjoyed by private sector managers to hire and retain the most effectiveemployees they can find. It also fails to provide the freedoms and incentives towould-be education entrepreneurs that are responsible for the scale-up of topproviders and effective new innovations in every other field."

Checking the facts
By Michael Carnuccio
With backroom deals and cronyism spreading throughout theupper Midwest like warm butter hits toast, it becomes critical to fact-check the
Feb-17-2017 004927
vocal minority lobbying for Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. Make no mistake,
when lawmakers return to Oklahoma City to address lawsuit reform in the comingspecial session, they will be inundated by the lobbying power of the hospital
industrial complex.
Proponents continue to say that expanding Medicaid, which requires a statematch, is no different than the state accepting funds for transportation, education,defense spending, the current Medicaid program and other federal programs. Inrecent public meetings, they have even likened Medicaid expansion to being assimple as if the federal government decided to expand a military base.Unfortunately, it's incorrect to compare creating a new entitlement class to nationaldefense, which requires no state match, and transportation funding, which is vastlyfunded by direct user taxes in gasoline excise taxes. It's also incorrect to compare
it to our current Medicaid program that is stressing the state budget.

Checking the facts
By Michael Carnuccio
With backroom deals and cronyism spreading throughout theupper Midwest like warm butter hits toast, it becomes critical to fact-check the
Feb-17-2017 004931
vocal minority lobbying for Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. Make no mistake,
when lawmakers return to Oklahoma City to address lawsuit reform in the comingspecial session, they will be inundated by the lobbying power of the hospital
industrial complex.
Proponents continue to say that expanding Medicaid, which requires a statematch, is no different than the state accepting funds for transportation, education,defense spending, the current Medicaid program and other federal programs. Inrecent public meetings, they have even likened Medicaid expansion to being assimple as if the federal government decided to expand a military base.Unfortunately, it's incorrect to compare creating a new entitlement class to nationaldefense, which requires no state match, and transportation funding, which is vastlyfunded by direct user taxes in gasoline excise taxes. It's also incorrect to compare
it to our current Medicaid program that is stressing the state budget.

This brief video makes the case that education is not synonymous withschooling.
In an age of customized education, Heritage Foundation scholar LindseyBurke says, policymakers must ensure that "education funding is free from19th-century ideas about schooling, in order to empower families to enjoythe benefits of 21st-century delivery models. School choice - whethervouchers, education tax credits, education savings accounts, or virtualschools - ensures that families won't be left behind when the online learningrevolution is in full force."

In Case You Missed It
The Oklahoman
IT expert: A data wake-up call forOklahomans
BY
THERESA
PAYTON
•
Published:
August
23,
2013
As
the
federal
government
prepares
to
implement
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
Oklahoma
Attorney
General
Scott
Pruitt
has
penned
a
joint
letter
with
12
fellow
AGs
asking
U.S.
Health
and
Human
Services
Secretary
Kathleen
Sebelius
important
questions
about
data
privacy.
These
are
questions
I
urge
Oklahomans
to
ask
on
their
own,
too.
In
order
to
implement
the
new
law,
questions
need
to
be
asked:
How
old
are
you?
Where
were
you
born?
Are
you
a
legal
resident?
Have
you
served
in
the
military?
Where
will
the
government
go
to
get
this
information?
The
Social
Security
Administration,
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
and
the
Veterans
Administration,
respectively.
This
data
will
go
into
“The
Hub,”
a
one-stop
destination
where
your
data
will
be
compiled
into
your
profile.
Reports
are
unclear
if
this
will
be
a
database
or
an
interface.
Regardless,
it
will
contain
Feb-17-2017 004965
all your biographical information extracted from seven federal agencies, and state agencies,
and
put
into
one
place.
It
is
a
hacker's
dream:
one-stop-shopping
for
all
of
the
details
of
your
personal
life.
Who
will
be
reviewing
this
data?
“Navigators,”
as
they
are
referred
to
in
the
new
legislation.
These
are
employees
hired
to
determine
your
eligibility
by
peeking
at
the
most
private
and
sensitive
details
of
your
life.
Among
the
questions
Pruitt
asks
in
the
joint
letter:
How
will
navigators
be
trained?
What's
the
plan
to
reduce
the
risk
of
identity
theft?
How
will
the
staff
be
screened
to
ensure
that
we
have
highly
skilled
people
with
the
utmost
integrity
looking
at
our
private
lives?
As
a
consumer,
this
is
your
wake-up
call.
Take
steps
now
to
protect
your
data.
Be
vigilant
about
what
you
post
on
social
media.
Identity
thieves
can
follow
the
information
you
post
like
digital
bread
crumbs
leading
back
to
your
house.
Contact
lawmakers
and
let
them
know
you
aren't
comfortable
with
a
database/interface
that
creates
a
one-stop-shop
for
cyber
hackers.
Use
one
email
address
only
for
your
health
insurance
company.
Ask
your
doctor
what
happens
with
your
data,
not
medical
history
per
se,
but
your
address,
phone
number,
etc.
Be
on
guard!
The
unprecedented
changes
being
made
to
the
collection
of
data
may
have
only
one
or
possibly
two
lines
of
defense
it
can't
penetrate
—
an
attorney
general
asking
the
right
questions
and
a
vigilant
consumer.

Competition could be costly
By Michael Carnuccio
There are incentives, and then there are deterrents. When initiallyput into place, the lower 1-percent tax rate for drilling horizontal wells in Oklahoma
Feb-17-2017 004968
was seen by many as an incentive. Spiking the rate up to 7 percent overnight
would be seen by many as a deterrent, and disincentive, to drill in the state.
Energy production is a cost-driven business. Increased costs, for any reason,including tax changes, have the ability to change a producer's behavior. If thegross production tax rate to drill a horizontal well in Oklahoma increases from 1percent to 7 percent, drilling in other states immediately becomes more attractive.

Maine Gov. Paul LePagehas been an outspoken advocate of lowering and eventually eliminating thestate personal income tax to boost economic growth. Now the MaineHeritage Policy Center (that state's counterpart to OCPA) has added a newwrinkle: selectively targeting depressed counties with major tax breaks.

yesterday in the

"The lessons of history and the hard numbers are clear: It is not fiscallyresponsible or wise to expand a strained entitlement program and rely onfederal funding that is unlikely," Coburn and Small write. "While it has beentempting for some consultants and lawmakers to try to dress up Medicaidexpansion as 'program redesign,' it is simply not in our state's long-terminterest to expand Medicaid, whether that's under the guise of additional

How to help
By Michael Carnuccio
Have you ever been in a tight spot financially? Ever had somethinggo wrong at the wrong time of the month? For many families, dollars are tight.
Feb-17-2017 004996
However, for most, the American way is to get a second job, clean out the attic on
Craigslist or, if the need is not as urgent, tighten the family belt - eating out lessand cutting back on the trips, the mall and the movies.
Many Oklahomans know what it is like to discover that an outdated water heaterthrew in the towel - no hot water to bathe the children. Unfortunately, no HomeDepot is close enough - or repair plan easy enough - when you are stationedseveral thousand miles away serving your country in the middle of the desert.
Unexpected changes for transitioning wounded service members, like a decreasein stability once military pay ceases and disability benefits have yet to begin, alsothreaten families in our communities who have already sacrificed so much.

A new way to do farm policy
Forward the cause:
Last week OCPA played host to more than 750 of our closest friends for theannual meeting of the State Policy Network, the service organization for thenation's free-market, state-focused think tank community. One of thehighlights of the week was hearing from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal(pictured above speaking on Sept. 24 in Oklahoma City).
Not only is Gov. Jindal one of the nation's leading champions of schoolchoice, but by refusing to go along with the Obamacare Medicaid expansionhe has reduced future federal spending by billions of dollars. Gov. Jindaland Oklahoma's own Sen. Tom Coburn continue to make the case that we
should not expand Medicaid.

Will Oklahoma expand Medicaid?
By Brandon Dutcher

to increased government
spending
A new way to do farm policy
Forward the cause:
Last week OCPA played host to more than 750 of our closest friends for theannual meeting of the State Policy Network, the service organization for thenation's free-market, state-focused think tank community. One of thehighlights of the week was hearing from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal(pictured above speaking on Sept. 24 in Oklahoma City).
Not only is Gov. Jindal one of the nation's leading champions of schoolchoice, but by refusing to go along with the Obamacare Medicaid expansionhe has reduced future federal spending by billions of dollars. Gov. Jindaland Oklahoma's own Sen. Tom Coburn continue to make the case that we
should not expand Medicaid.

It is customary, on Labor Day, to recall both the centrality of man to the
economy and
the inherent worth of work.
Inadvertently, because Labor Day is also a day on which Americansfrequently feast at a cookout, cruise on a lake or shop the sales, Labor Dayhas also recently become an annual occasion of self-pity and class envy.
It's easy to look at the neighbors' new grill, speedboat or full-price wardrobeand indulge the pangs of jealousy. Suddenly, Labor Day becomes less anopportunity to give gratitude for gainful employment than it is an opportunityto bemoan income inequality.

Could the U.S. Supreme Court's recent opinion in California's Proposition 8case possibly have an effect on Oklahoma's initiative and referendum
process?
Law professor Andrew Spiropoulos thinks it could. Spiropoulos, who servesas the Milton Friedman Distinguished Fellow at OCPA, believes that "as oneof the majority of states that permit the people to directly enact laws andconstitutional amendments, we Oklahomans should be discomfited, if notalarmed, by the consequences of the court's denial of standing to theproponents of Proposition 8."

Oklahoma math teacher decides to homeschool her own

Pruitt battling EPA's
environmental cronyism
Forward the cause:
Teacher
Today would have been the 101st birthday of Nobel Prize-winningeconomist Milton Friedman, who died in 2006 at the age of 94.
Friedman once observed that the explosive growth of homeschooling in thiscountry is "evidence of the failure of our current education system. There isno other complex field in our society in which do-it-yourself beats out factoryproduction or market production. Nobody makes his or her own car. But itstill is the case that parents can perform the job of educating their children,
in many cases better than our present education system."
It's not only
doctors and lawyers
who are joining the nation's fastest-growing
educational sector. Even some teachers, like Marcie Robbins of Bartlesville,are turning to homeschooling.

the

Thank you
Recently, a new acquaintance helpfully offered me a list of "free" events inOklahoma City and hospitably urged me to unite with her as she attendedthem.
"Join this young adult group," she urged. "So far, we've gone to a freeThunder game and a free happy hour. This week, we're going to a freeRedhawks game."
Later, she texted me to tell me the Myriad Gardens occasionally offers "free"movie nights.
The exchanges were redolent of conversations I used to have with cannyclassmates in college. My savviest friends could blithely articulate how a
shrewd student could eat for "free" every night of the week.

Truly reforming education
By Michael Carnuccio
Let's reflect on a public policy battle that has created quite a stiraround the country and will most assuredly do so through thepivotal election year that approaches.
Feb-17-2017 005086
First, support for common core standards is misguided. On the surface, theapproach to increase student achievement by establishing a higher bar as the floorfor common education seems noteworthy. The concept of ensuring that no child inany school district in any state is being educated at a lower level than his peer inanother school district of another state seems noble as well.
Unfortunately, this line of thinking misses the point of why the status quo issubstandard - the more we have shifted power and authority of education towardthe federal government, the worse our education system and product has become.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that since the creation of the federalDepartment of Education student performance has at best flat-lined while costshave skyrocketed.

Energy ConferenceMelissa,
I hope you are doing well.
 The reason for my call yesterday was to invite AG Pruitt to
speak at our October 17 Energy Conference in Tulsa.
 OCPA is partnering with Energy
Advocates, a non-profit energy education organization founded by Mark Stansberry
and others, to host another national conference on energy policy.
 We appreciated
AG Pruitt being involved in last year’s event, and we sincerely hope he is available to
participate again this year.
 While last year’s conference focused on energy and
federalism, this year we plan to focus on how energy policy impacts families.
The program will feature panel discussions, an awards luncheon, keynotepresentations, and legislative/litigation updates from elected officials and policy
makers at both the state and federal level.
 The panels and presentations are
designed to foster dialogue on the most current and critical energy topics.
 The
Feb-17-2017 005092
Impact Panel will focus on the impact of regulation and legislation on producers,
refinery capacity/downstream issues and why they matter, property rights, howpolicy decisions at each stage impact the economics of energy, and what it all means
to consumers at the pump and on their utility bills.
 The Regulatory Panel will focus
on the EPA’s current regional haze efforts, the adverse impact on energy companies,the science, the economics, and what can be done to move in a more positive
direction.
 The Tax Panel will feature an important discussion on energy taxes and
energy tax credits and best free market practices from around the country.
 The
luncheon will feature an awards ceremony honoring outstanding pioneers in theenergy industry, including a special award for women in energy.
Our plan would be to have AG Pruitt give a litigation update regarding his efforts on
regional haze, etc.
 He would be a featured speaker rather than a participant on a
panel.
 Please let me know if you have any questions about this project.
 AG Pruitt
may also be interested to know that, while the energy conference will take placeduring the day on the 17th, we are hosting our annual Liberty Gala that same
evening as a separate event.
 The keynote speaker will be George W. Bush, and Scott
would of course be welcome to stay for the banquet if he would like.

Shut it down
By Michael Carnuccio
I'm not sure shutdown is the right term. Remember, 83 percent ofthe federal government is still operating and the U.S. is on course to spend more
Feb-17-2017 005116
than $3.5 trillion. Essentially, we're no longer allowed to visit open-air parks and
war memorials because career politicians can't agree on how to spend money theydon't have.
I joined leaders from several state-based, grass-roots organizations across thecountry to issue an open letter to each member of the Congress:
The great historian and lecturer, Dr. J. Rufus Fears, distilled knowledge of the ageswhen he wrote that a nation "cannot live with a tremendous debt for a long periodof time. ... We must cut government spending." In the masterful constitutionaldesign, the U.S. House (of Representatives) was designed to be the most powerfulelement of Congress, and the best means to curb executive or judicial abuse. Asthe element in our Federalist political system closest to the people, only the Housecan slow down and even stop the pell-mell rush to fiscal ruin flowing from theExecutive Branch and its allies in the Senate.

Shut it down
By Michael Carnuccio
I'm not sure shutdown is the right term. Remember, 83 percent ofthe federal government is still operating and the U.S. is on course to spend more
Feb-17-2017 005118
than $3.5 trillion. Essentially, we're no longer allowed to visit open-air parks and
war memorials because career politicians can't agree on how to spend money theydon't have.
I joined leaders from several state-based, grass-roots organizations across thecountry to issue an open letter to each member of the Congress:
The great historian and lecturer, Dr. J. Rufus Fears, distilled knowledge of the ageswhen he wrote that a nation "cannot live with a tremendous debt for a long periodof time. ... We must cut government spending." In the masterful constitutionaldesign, the U.S. House (of Representatives) was designed to be the most powerfulelement of Congress, and the best means to curb executive or judicial abuse. Asthe element in our Federalist political system closest to the people, only the Housecan slow down and even stop the pell-mell rush to fiscal ruin flowing from theExecutive Branch and its allies in the Senate.

Cut waste and pay teachers
By Michael Carnuccio
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Janet Barresi hassuggested giving Oklahoma schoolteachers a $2,000 pay raise, funded with a
Feb-17-2017 005130
combination of school district carry-over funds and a 2-percent reduction in
administrative overhead.
I applaud Barresi's idea of using existing money to fund pay hikes. Achievingefficiencies in an organization can result in employees receiving better pay forbetter performance. Organizations routinely decide to realign expendituresinternally to reallocate resources to employees who are more deserving.
Lord knows there are efficiencies to be found in common education. The dramaticgrowth and bloat in administration is well-documented. When Oklahoma has nearlyas many non-teachers as teachers, something is wrong.

Obamacare continues to fail

Liberty is gaining ground
Vedder vs. Obama on
higher-ed policy
Forward the cause:
Last week Oklahomans received the
news
that Obamacare will increase
premiums in Oklahoma. Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doakmade the announcement after insurance companies filed their policy ratesto be offered in the federal exchange.
Staunch advocates of Obamacare have been upset with the facts. While thenews released by Commissioner Doak and the Insurance Departmentdoesn't fit their narrative, this increase in premiums should not be a surprise.The previous insurance commissioner, Kim Holland, and numerous otherswarned of the flaws in Obamacare that were going to result in these sorts of
premium increases. Even
Barack Obama's own administration
has admitted
some will see premium increases because of Obamacare.

Obamacare continues to fail
By Jonathan Small, CPA
Feb-17-2017 005152
Liberty is gaining ground
Vedder vs. Obama on
higher-ed policy
Forward the cause:
Last week Oklahomans received the
news
that Obamacare will increase
premiums in Oklahoma. Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doakmade the announcement after insurance companies filed their policy ratesto be offered in the federal exchange.
Staunch advocates of Obamacare have been upset with the facts. While thenews released by Commissioner Doak and the Insurance Departmentdoesn't fit their narrative, this increase in premiums should not be a surprise.The previous insurance commissioner, Kim Holland, and numerous otherswarned of the flaws in Obamacare that were going to result in these sorts of
premium increases. Even
Barack Obama's own administration
has admitted
some will see premium increases because of Obamacare.

Subject:RE: Renewable Fuel Standard - Background InformationDate:07/13/2013 06:41 AMGood morning Clayton,
Here are responses to the questions raised in your email.
 1.
AFPM will be filing a joint petition with the API.
 We are aiming to file the waiver petition
later this month.2.
We think it would be most effective for Oklahoma to file a separate waiver petition thatemphasizes “severe environmental harm,” as this argument is more credible coming from a
State with primary responsibility for achieving and maintaining attainment with the NAAQS.
At this point we are not planning on including the environmental arguments in our waiver
petition.
 Oklahoma has standing under section 211(o)(7) to file its own waiver petition and I
can walk you through the procedural aspects of this filing.3.
Yes.
 EPA’s prior waiver denials were based on the fact that the roughly the same amount of
ethanol would have been used even if the waiver was granted.
 This waiver petition is
different in that it would alleviate the pressure caused by the RFS mandate requiring more
ethanol than can be safely folded into the gasoline supply (10 percent).
 The 2014 volumetric
mandates are significantly higher, and the RFS requires additional increases in subsequent
years. 
In addition, the “severe environmental harm” argument is a matter of first
impression.4.
We would ask OK to file its own waiver petition that develops the severe environmental
harm argument.
 The petition also could address the other statutory elements supporting a
waiver (i.e., severe economic harm and inadequate domestic supply). Let me know if you need additional information or if we should schedule a follow-up phone call nextweek.

Rich

Thank you for the information and the phone call and I apologize for not being up to speed on the issue. 
I
have had the opportunity now to become more familiar with the RFS and it's obvious shortcomings and
problems. 
I think it is safe to say that AG Pruitt has an interest in the issue.
I recall in the phone conversation that you planned to file a Petition for RFS Waiver, I have severalquestions.
1. 
On whose behalf will you be filing the Petition?
2. 
You mentioned using Oklahoma (and other states?) to highlight the severe economic and
environmental harm to the State by the RFS, is this the role you envision for Oklahoma? 
How does that
work specifically?
3. 
EPA has denied Petitions for RFS Waivers that have been requested by industry and 7 State
governors, is the Petition for RFS Waiver that you are contemplating different than those, ie... on different
grounds 
 etc...?
4. 
What specifically are you asking the Oklahoma AG's Office to do regarding the Petition and this issue?
Hopefully I haven't missed the boat too much on these questions but I want to make sure I fullyunderstand what Oklahoma's role will be.
Thank you again for your work on this issue.

Subject:RE: Renewable Fuel Standard - Background InformationDate:07/13/2013 06:41 AMGood morning Clayton,
Here are responses to the questions raised in your email.
 1.
AFPM will be filing a joint petition with the API.
 We are aiming to file the waiver petition
later this month.2.
We think it would be most effective for Oklahoma to file a separate waiver petition thatemphasizes “severe environmental harm,” as this argument is more credible coming from a
State with primary responsibility for achieving and maintaining attainment with the NAAQS.
At this point we are not planning on including the environmental arguments in our waiver
petition.
 Oklahoma has standing under section 211(o)(7) to file its own waiver petition and I
can walk you through the procedural aspects of this filing.3.
Yes.
 EPA’s prior waiver denials were based on the fact that the roughly the same amount of
ethanol would have been used even if the waiver was granted.
 This waiver petition is
different in that it would alleviate the pressure caused by the RFS mandate requiring more
ethanol than can be safely folded into the gasoline supply (10 percent).
 The 2014 volumetric
mandates are significantly higher, and the RFS requires additional increases in subsequent
years. 
In addition, the “severe environmental harm” argument is a matter of first
impression.4.
We would ask OK to file its own waiver petition that develops the severe environmental
harm argument.
 The petition also could address the other statutory elements supporting a
waiver (i.e., severe economic harm and inadequate domestic supply). Let me know if you need additional information or if we should schedule a follow-up phone call nextweek.
Best regards,
Rich

Thank you for the information and the phone call and I apologize for not being up to speed on the issue. 
I
have had the opportunity now to become more familiar with the RFS and it's obvious shortcomings and
problems. 
I think it is safe to say that AG Pruitt has an interest in the issue.
I recall in the phone conversation that you planned to file a Petition for RFS Waiver, I have severalquestions.
1. 
On whose behalf will you be filing the Petition?
2. 
You mentioned using Oklahoma (and other states?) to highlight the severe economic and
environmental harm to the State by the RFS, is this the role you envision for Oklahoma? 
How does that
work specifically?
3. 
EPA has denied Petitions for RFS Waivers that have been requested by industry and 7 State
governors, is the Petition for RFS Waiver that you are contemplating different than those, ie... on different
grounds

Subject:Re: Renewable Fuel Standard - Background InformationDate:07/12/2013 02:20 PMRichard,Thank you for the information and the phone call and I apologize for not being up to
speed on the issue.
 I have had the opportunity now to become more familiar with the
RFS and it's obvious shortcomings and problems.
 I think it is safe to say that AG Pruitt
has an interest in the issue.I recall in the phone conversation that you planned to file a Petition for RFS Waiver, Ihave several questions.
1.
 On whose behalf will you be filing the Petition?
2.
 You mentioned using Oklahoma (and other states?) to highlight the severe economic
and environmental harm to the State by the RFS, is this the role you envision for
Oklahoma?
 How does that work specifically?
3.
 EPA has denied Petitions for RFS Waivers that have been requested by industry and
7 State governors, is the Petition for RFS Waiver that you are contemplating different
than those, ie... on different grounds
 etc...?
4.
 What specifically are you asking the Oklahoma AG's Office to do regarding the
Petition and this issue?Hopefully I haven't missed the boat too much on these questions but I want to makesure I fully understand what Oklahoma's role will be.
Thank you again for your work on this issue.

Dear General Pruitt –
I hope you are doing well!
Attached you will find AFPM’s 2014 Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) waiver petition which was filedwith the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on August 13. While this petition does not addressenvironmental harm, it provides compelling support on the economic harm cause by the ethanolblendwall under the RFS mandate. The filing of this petition starts the statutory 90-day time periodwithin which EPA must respond.
AFPM remains very interested in the prospect of your state filing a similar waiver requesthighlighting the environmental harm caused by the RFS mandate which we discussed previously. Iwould be happy to answer any questions you may have. Please feel free to contact me at

Re: DC Meeting
Hi,
Clayton
-
I
hope
you
and
your
family
survived
the
tornadoes
without
incident.
We
are
certainly
thinking
of
you
and
your
fellow
Oklahomans.
I
assumed
things
would
be
quite
hectic,
so
was
going
to
wait
a
few
days
before
I
reached
out
to
you.
However,
I
am
now
out
of
the
office
on
maternity
leave,
but
we
certainly
still
want
to
update
you
on
our
issues.
It
may
be
easiest
for
you
to
setup
a
time
with
Rich
and
Dave
-
they
will
be
able
to
provide
you
with
the
information
General
Pruitt
is
interested
in.
Thanks!

Hi,
Clayton
-
I
hope
you
and
your
family
survived
the
tornadoes
without
incident.
We
are
certainly
thinking
of
you
and
your
fellow
Oklahomans.
I
assumed
things
would
be
quite
hectic,
so
was
going
to
wait
a
few
days
before
I
reached
out
to
you.
However,
I
am
now
out
Feb-17-2017 005211
of the office on maternity leave, but we certainly still want to update
you
on
our
issues.
It
may
be
easiest
for
you
to
setup
a
time
with
Rich
and
Dave
-
they
will
be
able
to
provide
you
with
the
information
General
Pruitt
is
interested
in.
Thanks!

Clayton – I wanted to share with you 
a rough draft of an amicus brief.
 Normally, I wouldn’t send out

 going.
Please don’t send it out ofyour office at this point. 
 It has not been reviewed at all by my client
 and it could change a lot.
 Let
me know if you think we’re duplicating what you’re petition will say or if there are other points weshould make.
Not sure how many states we will get to sign on.
 We may try for a wide circulation.

Clayton, hi, haven’t talked for a while, hope all is well, other than that horrible 10th Cir decision.
I don’t know if you know, but we represent Arizona in its similar appeal of EPA’s regional haze
decision as to Arizona.
 I saw today that AG Pruitt has announced that you will file a petition for
rehearing en banc.
 I’m really glad you decided to do so.
I’m attaching the brief we filed in the Ninth Circuit.
 It was submitted about a week after the OK
decision came down, so we addressed the decision in our brief.
 You will see we spent a great deal of
time on standard of review, because we felt that is the key issue in the case – and where the 10thCircuit really got it wrong because I think its decision conflicts with the Supreme Court’s decision in
Alaska DEC v. EPA.
 It could be a fruitful argument to make in the rehearing petition.
In fact, I have recommended to the AZ AG’s office that they file an amicus brief in support of yourrehearing request in which they would make this argument, and maybe join with a couple of other
states in doing so.

Very well written, we
definitely used it to try and focus our arguments on the standard of review issue in our Petition for
Rehearing En Banc. 
We continue to work on our draft Petition and plan to file next Tuesday. 
Amicus support is welcomed and we appreciate the support, especially given the broad impact the panels

Hopefully the Court will agree and grant the rehearing.

Regional hazeClayton, hi, haven’t talked for a while, hope all is well, other than that horrible 10th Cir decision.
I don’t know if you know, but we represent Arizona in its similar appeal of EPA’s regional haze decision as to Arizona.
I saw today that AG Pruitt has announced that you will file a petition for rehearing en banc. 
I’m really glad you
decided to do so.
Feb-17-2017 005258
I’m attaching the brief we filed in the Ninth Circuit.  It was submitted about a week after the OK decision came
down, so we addressed the decision in our brief. 
You will see we spent a great deal of time on standard of review,
because we felt that is the key issue in the case – and where the 10th Circuit really got it wrong because I think its
decision conflicts with the Supreme Court’s decision in Alaska DEC v. EPA. 
It could be a fruitful argument to make in
the rehearing petition. 
In fact, I have recommended to the AZ AG’s office that they file an amicus brief in support of your rehearing request
in which they would make this argument, and maybe join with a couple of other states in doing so. 
Hopefully, we
can make that happen.
Good luck.

Please don’t send it out of your office at this point. 
 It

Let me know if you think we’re duplicating what

Not sure how many states we will get to sign on. 
We may try for a wide circulation.

Subject: 
Regional haze Clayton, hi, haven’t talked for a while, hope all is well, other than that horrible 10th Cir decision. 
 I don’t know if you know, but we represent Arizona in its similar appeal of EPA’s regional haze decision as to Arizona.
I saw today that AG Pruitt has announced that you will file a petition for rehearing en banc. 
I’m really glad you
decided to do so. 
I’m attaching the brief we filed in the Ninth Circuit. 
It was submitted about a week after the OK decision came
down, so we addressed the decision in our brief. 
You will see we spent a great deal of time on standard of review,
because we felt that is the key issue in the case – and where the 10th Circuit really got it wrong because I think its
decision conflicts with the Supreme Court’s decision in Alaska DEC v. EPA. 
It could be a fruitful argument to make in
the rehearing petition. 
 In fact, I have recommended to the AZ AG’s office that they file an amicus brief in support of your rehearing request
in which they would make this argument, and maybe join with a couple of other states in doing so. 
Hopefully, we
can make that happen.

Good luck.

Thank you Peter, Irecived a copy of your merits brief from someone recently. 
Very well
written, we definitely used it to try and focus our arguments on the standard of review issue
in our Petition for Rehearing En Banc. 
We continue to work on our draft Petition and plan
to file next Tuesday. 
Amicus support is welcomed and we appreciate the support, especially given the broad

Hopefully the Court will agree
and grant the rehearing.
Thanks again.

Regional haze
Clayton, hi, haven’t talked for a while, hope all is well, other than that horrible 10th Cir decision.
I don’t know if you know, but we represent Arizona in its similar appeal of EPA’s regional haze
decision as to Arizona. 
I saw today that AG Pruitt has announced that you will file a petition for
rehearing en banc. 
I’m really glad you decided to do so.
I’m attaching the brief we filed in the Ninth Circuit. 
It was submitted about a week after the OK
decision came down, so we addressed the decision in our brief. 
You will see we spent a great deal of
time on standard of review, because we felt that is the key issue in the case – and where the 10thCircuit really got it wrong because I think its decision conflicts with the Supreme Court’s decision in
Alaska DEC v. EPA. 
It could be a fruitful argument to make in the rehearing petition. 
In fact, I have recommended to the AZ AG’s office that they file an amicus brief in support of yourrehearing request in which they would make this argument, and maybe join with a couple of other
states in doing so. 
Hopefully, we can make that happen.
Good luck.

Subject: 
Regional haze Clayton, hi, haven’t talked for a while, hope all is well, other than that horrible 10th Cir decision. 
 I don’t know if you know, but we represent Arizona in its similar appeal of EPA’s regional haze decision as to Arizona.
I saw today that AG Pruitt has announced that you will file a petition for rehearing en banc. 
I’m really glad you
decided to do so. 
I’m attaching the brief we filed in the Ninth Circuit. 
It was submitted about a week after the OK decision came
down, so we addressed the decision in our brief. 
You will see we spent a great deal of time on standard of review,
because we felt that is the key issue in the case – and where the 10th Circuit really got it wrong because I think its
decision conflicts with the Supreme Court’s decision in Alaska DEC v. EPA. 
It could be a fruitful argument to make in
the rehearing petition. 
 In fact, I have recommended to the AZ AG’s office that they file an amicus brief in support of your rehearing request
in which they would make this argument, and maybe join with a couple of other states in doing so. 
Hopefully, we
can make that happen.

Good luck.

Thank you Peter, Irecived a copy of your merits brief from someone recently. 
Very well
written, we definitely used it to try and focus our arguments on the standard of review issue
in our Petition for Rehearing En Banc. 
We continue to work on our draft Petition and plan
to file next Tuesday. 
Amicus support is welcomed and we appreciate the support, especially given the broad
impact the panels incorrect decision will have nationwide. 
Hopefully the Court will agree
and grant the rehearing.
Thanks again.

Regional haze
Clayton, hi, haven’t talked for a while, hope all is well, other than that horrible 10th Cir decision.
I don’t know if you know, but we represent Arizona in its similar appeal of EPA’s regional haze
decision as to Arizona. 
I saw today that AG Pruitt has announced that you will file a petition for
rehearing en banc. 
I’m really glad you decided to do so.
I’m attaching the brief we filed in the Ninth Circuit. 
It was submitted about a week after the OK
decision came down, so we addressed the decision in our brief. 
You will see we spent a great deal of
time on standard of review, because we felt that is the key issue in the case – and where the 10thCircuit really got it wrong because I think its decision conflicts with the Supreme Court’s decision in
Alaska DEC v. EPA. 
It could be a fruitful argument to make in the rehearing petition. 
In fact, I have recommended to the AZ AG’s office that they file an amicus brief in support of yourrehearing request in which they would make this argument, and maybe join with a couple of other
states in doing so. 
Hopefully, we can make that happen.
Good luck.

Subject:RE: Oklahoma Regional Haze Petition for Rehearing - Amicus Brief In Support of States' Authority Under the CAADate:09/04/2013 10:56 AM
Blake – thx.
 One additional point on behalf of AZ.
The Tenth Circuit panel, in a 2-1 decision, issued a truly awful decision that affirms EPA’s overreach
into matters that the Clean Air Act leaves to State discretion.
The panel decision will affect not only those States with regional haze SIPs that EPA has alsodisapproved, like AZ and six other states, but also states that in the future will submit regional haze
SIPs.
 EPA’s regional haze program will last another 50 years, and states have to submit new SIPs
every 10 years.
 Most eastern states have so far been exempt from regional haze Best Available
Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements because of CAIR and CSAPR.
 But this exemption is under
attack in court, and if the attack is successful, eastern states may also have to make BART
determinations.
 The decision is also bad precedent for state-federal relations under the Clean Air
Act generally.
Because the panel was divided, there is a real shot at rehearing en banc.
 Strong State participation
in this effort could help tip the balance.
 We hope you will join us.

Clayton – I wanted to share with you a rough draft of an amicus brief. 
Normally, I wouldn’t send out anything this
rough, but I wanted to let you see the direction we’re going. 
Please don’t send it out of your office at this point. 
 It
has not been reviewed at all by my client and it could change a lot. 
Let me know if you think we’re duplicating what
you’re petition will say or if there are other points we should make.
Not sure how many states we will get to sign on. 
We may try for a wide circulation.

Clayton – I wanted to share with you a rough draft of an amicus brief. 
Normally, I wouldn’t send out anything this
rough, but I wanted to let you see the direction we’re going. 
Please don’t send it out of your office at this point. 
 It
has not been reviewed at all by my client and it could change a lot. 
Let me know if you think we’re duplicating what
you’re petition will say or if there are other points we should make.
Not sure how many states we will get to sign on. 
We may try for a wide circulation.

More than 20 other states have rejected Medicaid expansion,thereby preventing half a trillion dollars in deficit spending that ourkids and grandkids would have had to pay.
Feb-17-2017 004739
Keep in mind, what began as a $1 billion national entitlement in 1966 is projected
to hit $900 billion by 2020. In terms of future costs, Matt Salo, the executivedirector of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, noted in testimony:"More people show up than you think will show up, and the people that show upare sicker than you expected." Even if the debt-ridden federal government keepsits commitment to fund expansion at 90 percent, Oklahoma's 10-percent share isof an unknown number. That blank check is uncontrollable and unpredictable, nomatter what expansionists say.

Time to eject
By Michael Carnuccio
In 2006, Barack Obama, then a junior senator from Illinois, said
"Raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure."
Of course, since
Feb-17-2017 004750
becoming the CEO of the United States, he has done so many times.
So we narrowly avoided default, again. The significance of this conversation - andjust how close we are continuing to get to the brink - should have us removingevery current officeholder in our nation's Capitol. A mountainous economic disasteris being administered by people who are unqualified and incapable of leadership.They are too occupied with a popularity crisis.
Someone should tell them the prettiest girl on the Titanic still died.

Education Next, a journal published bythe Hoover Institution at Stanford University, Dr. Greene explains how to fixtraditional public schools. "We can fix schools," he writes, "by going aroundthem."
We can expand access to other educational options, including charterschools, voucher schools, tax-credit schools, ESAs, digital schooling,home-schooling, and hybrid schools. We can also expand access toenriching non-school activities, like museums, theaters, historical sites,summer camps, and after-school programs. Reformers shouldconcentrate their energy on all of these non-traditional-school effortsand stop trying so hard to fix traditional public schools.

Friends,I would like to invite you to join me for a very special evening on Friday, July 19at 6:30 p.m. on the campus of Oklahoma Christian University, where we willfeature presentations from Four Star Leadership students and a keynote speechfrom my friend Karl Rove. I am confident Mr. Rove will provide a memorableexperience for our students and guests, but I am also certain that you would
personally be inspired and uplifted by spending time with these young people.  
Feb-17-2017 004782
Out of concern for the future of our nation and a desire to build up youngleaders to help direct her steps, my friends and I created the Four StarLeadership program, a world-class summer leadership program that allows 50of the top high school students in the US to have a face-to-face experience withnational and international leaders. I am excited that OCPA is partnering with meto help conduct the program, and I would like to invite you to see just how
special it is. 
This year's class contains students representing 30 different states as well as 2foreign countries and is truly a once in a lifetime experience for these youngpeople as they interact with their peers from around the country and around theworld. During the week, the students learn from outstanding leadership andpolicy experts while also being challenged through hands-on learningexperiences designed to help sharpen their leadership and communicationskills, all while competing for college scholarships. I hope you can join KarlRove, 50 of America's best and brightest young leaders, and me for this unique
event. 
Please see the information below for details or contact OCPA with anyquestions you may have.

Friends,I would like to invite you to join me for a very special evening on Friday, July 19at 6:30 p.m. on the campus of Oklahoma Christian University, where we willfeature presentations from Four Star Leadership students and a keynote speechfrom my friend Karl Rove. I am confident Mr. Rove will provide a memorableexperience for our students and guests, but I am also certain that you would
personally be inspired and uplifted by spending time with these young people.

Out of concern for the future of our nation and a desire to build up youngleaders to help direct her steps, my friends and I created the Four StarLeadership program, a world-class summer leadership program that allows 50of the top high school students in the US to have a face-to-face experience withnational and international leaders. I am excited that OCPA is partnering with meto help conduct the program, and I would like to invite you to see just how
special it is. 
This year's class contains students representing 30 different states as well as 2foreign countries and is truly a once in a lifetime experience for these youngpeople as they interact with their peers from around the country and around theworld. During the week, the students learn from outstanding leadership andpolicy experts while also being challenged through hands-on learningexperiences designed to help sharpen their leadership and communicationskills, all while competing for college scholarships. I hope you can join KarlRove, 50 of America's best and brightest young leaders, and me for this unique
event. 
Please see the information below for details or contact OCPA with anyquestions you may have.

I think many of us would be hard-pressed to remember. It was a Saturday.In fact, Oklahoma City actually set a record high for the day at 74 degrees.Spring was in the air, and whether you knew it or not, it was a great day to
breathe a sigh of relief.

Forward the cause:

Proponents of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, whether via premiumassistance or via traditional Medicaid, are using desperate and dishonestarguments to try to persuade Oklahoma policymakers and citizens toexpand Medicaid.
One of the chief falsehoods is that "if Oklahoma doesn't act, our tax dollarswill be sent to other states." This argument demonstrates a complete lack ofunderstanding of the federal/state welfare program known as Medicaid.

Forward the cause:

Recently, OCPA released
a new memo
(a short read, with visuals) detailing
the success of Oklahoma's income tax cuts since 2005.
Couple this with Oklahoma's data from the "How Money Walks" project (seeblog for data). Then the correlation becomes very strong, indeed: as incometax cuts have helped propel Oklahoma's private-sector economy, overall
state tax revenues have risen to record highs.

Subject:Thank youDate:08/05/2013 05:09 PMThank you again for participating in the OCPA conference call last week to discuss the recent
Oklahoma voter survey on the topic of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. 
The call was one of six
we held during the week with different groups.
Please let me know if we can provide follow-up info related to the survey or on the subject ofMedicaid expansion. OCPA will continue to work to drive dialogue about the negative impactsadopting Medicaid expansion would have on Oklahoma. On that note, here are some recent items:
“Leavitt report is still Obamacare” (

Free Market Friday: Priorities
By Michael Carnuccio
We spend a good amount of time in political conversations aboutthe right direction for our community, state and nation. Most seemto agree that socialism is not a desired pathway for the American dream.
Feb-17-2017 004869
Functional democracies require a different corridor. Rightly so; government owning
and administering the means of production and distribution of goods has neverworked out well for the polity.
Likewise, we spend a lot of time and energy in society exploring for the best waysto provide a quality education. Ironically, the majority of those endeavors involvetrimming the edges of socialism. Whether the state grades our schools or not, westill have socialism. Whether we adopt Common Core standards or not, it's stillsocialism - and that isn't working out well for our children.

one-year extension
Forward the cause:
"A relieved Gov. Mary Fallin recently announced that the Obamaadministration has agreed to wait a year before euthanizing the Insure
Oklahoma health insurance program,"
OCPA distinguished fellow Andrew
Spiropoulos writes in his latest

column.
So why have the feds given us a reprieve? The administrationperceives an opportunity to use our state's leaders' support of InsureOklahoma as a wedge to break Oklahoma's resistance to the
expansion of Medicaid.
...What's the president's plan? It's very clever.
He will offer to allow us to take all or part of the Medicaid expansionmoney and use it to expand Insure Oklahoma. The pitch is that we cankeep our plan and get the money, too. However, here's the truth - if we
take the deal, it won't be our plan any longer.

Lottery continues to exploit

Forward the cause:
Virginian Joel Salatin describes himself as a "Christian, libertarian,environmentalist, capitalist farmer
."
Farmer Salatin not only lectures about
farming techniques that boost profit with lower input, he is also a prolificspeaker on the legacy of the family farm. He calls for a shift to the
household economy to increase individual and family freedom.
Salatin operates a family store two hours outside of Washington, D.C.,
where he primarily sells chicken and pork.
Customers must come to him as
he won't throw a chicken in the mail to you.
He is a firm believer in keeping
food and the money that buys the food in the local economy. Twenty yearsago, most of his customers were back-to-the-earth hippies whereas now the
fastest-growing customer segment is the homeschooling family.

Income is flowing out of Oklahoma
By Brandon Dutcher
Feb-17-2017 004909
Oklahoma should push
back against IRS
The great job killer
Forward the cause:
"Economists have long studied migration between the states becausemigration is the ultimate expression of 'voting with your feet,'" OCPAeconomists J. Scott Moody and Wendy P. Warcholik write. "In other words,more people moving into a state is a good sign of social and economicprogress, whereas more people leaving a state is not a good sign."
Over the last two decades Oklahoma has experienced a healthy net in-migration of people. Disturbingly, though, "despite the influx of people,income has been flowing out of Oklahoma - including during a few yearswhen more people moved in than moved out - suggesting that out-migrantshad higher-than-average incomes than in-migrants. Between 1995 and2009, at least $831,553,000 (not adjusted for inflation) left the state."

Parental choice preferable to increased government spending

DHS food-stamp advocacy
inappropriate
Forward the cause:
Constitutional lawyer Clint Bolick once described our public educationsystem as a "hidebound, bureaucratic, expensive, top-down, one-size-fits-all, command-and-control, inefficient, reform-resistant, administrativelybloated, special-interest-manipulated, obsolete, impersonal bricks-and-mortar system that represents the most disastrous failure of central planningwest of Communist China and south of the United States Postal Service."
Curiously, some Oklahomans think it's a good idea to give this system
more
money. But as I argued last week in
The Edmond Sun, a better idea is togive parents vouchers, tax credits, and Arizona-style education savingsaccounts. After all, private-school choice improves student performance
in
public
schools.

year veteran teacher in South Korea, earns $4 million a year teaching in the

country's private, after-school tutoring academies. He is paid according to the
demand for his skills, unlike most teachers across the globe.
Don't forget, South Korean students rank among the best in the world.
As education economist Andrew Coulsen points out, merit pay may not be as easya solution for Oklahoma. "Offering merit pay to teachers does nothing to liberateprincipals from the shackles of union contracts and state licensing requirementsthat determine whom they can hire and fire. Neither does it give principals theincentives enjoyed by private sector managers to hire and retain the most effectiveemployees they can find. It also fails to provide the freedoms and incentives towould-be education entrepreneurs that are responsible for the scale-up of topproviders and effective new innovations in every other field."

Checking the facts
By Michael Carnuccio
With backroom deals and cronyism spreading throughout theupper Midwest like warm butter hits toast, it becomes critical to fact-check the
Feb-17-2017 004927
vocal minority lobbying for Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. Make no mistake,
when lawmakers return to Oklahoma City to address lawsuit reform in the comingspecial session, they will be inundated by the lobbying power of the hospital
industrial complex.
Proponents continue to say that expanding Medicaid, which requires a statematch, is no different than the state accepting funds for transportation, education,defense spending, the current Medicaid program and other federal programs. Inrecent public meetings, they have even likened Medicaid expansion to being assimple as if the federal government decided to expand a military base.Unfortunately, it's incorrect to compare creating a new entitlement class to nationaldefense, which requires no state match, and transportation funding, which is vastlyfunded by direct user taxes in gasoline excise taxes. It's also incorrect to compare
it to our current Medicaid program that is stressing the state budget.

PAYTON
•
Published:
August
23,
2013
As
the
federal
government
prepares
to
implement
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
Oklahoma
Attorney
General
Scott
Pruitt
has
penned
a
joint
letter
with
12
fellow
AGs
asking
U.S.
Health
and
Human
Services
Secretary
Kathleen
Sebelius
important
questions
about
data
privacy.
These
are
questions
I
urge
Oklahomans
to
ask
on
their
own,
too.
In
order
to
implement
the
new
law,
questions
need
to
be
asked:
How
old
are
you?
Where
were
you
born?
Are
you
a
legal
resident?
Have
you
served
in
the
military?
Where
will
the
government
go
to
get
this
information?
The
Social
Security
Administration,
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
and
the
Veterans
Administration,
respectively.
This
data
will
go
into
“The
Hub,”
a
one-stop
destination
where
your
data
will
be
compiled
into
your
profile.
Reports
are
unclear
if
this
will
be
a
database
or
an
interface.
Regardless,
it
will
contain
Feb-17-2017 004965
all your biographical information extracted from seven federal agencies, and state agencies,
and
put
into
one
place.
It
is
a
hacker's
dream:
one-stop-shopping
for
all
of
the
details
of
your
personal
life.
Who
will
be
reviewing
this
data?
“Navigators,”
as
they
are
referred
to
in
the
new
legislation.
These
are
employees
hired
to
determine
your
eligibility
by
peeking
at
the
most
private
and
sensitive
details
of
your
life.
Among
the
questions
Pruitt
asks
in
the
joint
letter:
How
will
navigators
be
trained?
What's
the
plan
to
reduce
the
risk
of
identity
theft?
How
will
the
staff
be
screened
to
ensure
that
we
have
highly
skilled
people
with
the
utmost
integrity
looking
at
our
private
lives?
As
a
consumer,
this
is
your
wake-up
call.
Take
steps
now
to
protect
your
data.
Be
vigilant
about
what
you
post
on
social
media.
Identity
thieves
can
follow
the
information
you
post
like
digital
bread
crumbs
leading
back
to
your
house.
Contact
lawmakers
and
let
them
know
you
aren't
comfortable
with
a
database/interface
that
creates
a
one-stop-shop
for
cyber
hackers.
Use
one
email
address
only
for
your
health
insurance
company.
Ask
your
doctor
what
happens
with
your
data,
not
medical
history
per
se,
but
your
address,
phone
number,
etc.
Be
on
guard!
The
unprecedented
changes
being
made
to
the
collection
of
data
may
have
only
one
or
possibly
two
lines
of
defense
it
can't
penetrate
—
an
attorney
general
asking
the
right
questions
and
a
vigilant
consumer.

Competition could be costly
By Michael Carnuccio
There are incentives, and then there are deterrents. When initiallyput into place, the lower 1-percent tax rate for drilling horizontal wells in Oklahoma
Feb-17-2017 004968
was seen by many as an incentive. Spiking the rate up to 7 percent overnight
would be seen by many as a deterrent, and disincentive, to drill in the state.
Energy production is a cost-driven business. Increased costs, for any reason,including tax changes, have the ability to change a producer's behavior. If thegross production tax rate to drill a horizontal well in Oklahoma increases from 1percent to 7 percent, drilling in other states immediately becomes more attractive.

was seen by many as an incentive. Spiking the rate up to 7 percent overnight
would be seen by many as a deterrent, and disincentive, to drill in the state.
Energy production is a cost-driven business. Increased costs, for any reason,including tax changes, have the ability to change a producer's behavior. If thegross production tax rate to drill a horizontal well in Oklahoma increases from 1percent to 7 percent, drilling in other states immediately becomes more attractive.

Maine may be a couple thousand miles away, but it's a lot like Oklahoma inone way: some of its counties are richer, while some are poorer, with higherunemployment and lower personal-income levels. Maine Gov. Paul LePagehas been an outspoken advocate of lowering and eventually eliminating thestate personal income tax to boost economic growth. Now the MaineHeritage Policy Center (that state's counterpart to OCPA) has added a newwrinkle: selectively targeting depressed counties with major tax breaks.

By OCPA

Oklahoma
Parental choice preferable
to increased government
spending
Forward the cause:
Former OCPA trustee Dr. Tom Coburn and current OCPA fiscal policydirector Jonathan Small have been two of the leading voices in Oklahomawarning against the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. In a column published
yesterday in the
Tulsa World, they make the argument that policymakersshould continue to oppose expanding Medicaid - in any form.
"The lessons of history and the hard numbers are clear: It is not fiscallyresponsible or wise to expand a strained entitlement program and rely onfederal funding that is unlikely," Coburn and Small write. "While it has beentempting for some consultants and lawmakers to try to dress up Medicaidexpansion as 'program redesign,' it is simply not in our state's long-terminterest to expand Medicaid, whether that's under the guise of additional
federal funding or creative program designs.
Given the economic facts, any
expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would be a step in thewrong direction."

Dr. Coburn, OCPA warn against Medicaid expansion - in any
form
By OCPA

Oklahoma
Parental choice preferable
to increased government
spending
Forward the cause:
Former OCPA trustee Dr. Tom Coburn and current OCPA fiscal policydirector Jonathan Small have been two of the leading voices in Oklahomawarning against the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. In a column published
yesterday in the
Tulsa World, they make the argument that policymakersshould continue to oppose expanding Medicaid - in any form.
"The lessons of history and the hard numbers are clear: It is not fiscallyresponsible or wise to expand a strained entitlement program and rely onfederal funding that is unlikely," Coburn and Small write. "While it has beentempting for some consultants and lawmakers to try to dress up Medicaidexpansion as 'program redesign,' it is simply not in our state's long-terminterest to expand Medicaid, whether that's under the guise of additional
federal funding or creative program designs.
Given the economic facts, any
expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would be a step in thewrong direction."

How to help
By Michael Carnuccio
Have you ever been in a tight spot financially? Ever had somethinggo wrong at the wrong time of the month? For many families, dollars are tight.
Feb-17-2017 004996
However, for most, the American way is to get a second job, clean out the attic on
Craigslist or, if the need is not as urgent, tighten the family belt - eating out lessand cutting back on the trips, the mall and the movies.
Many Oklahomans know what it is like to discover that an outdated water heaterthrew in the towel - no hot water to bathe the children. Unfortunately, no HomeDepot is close enough - or repair plan easy enough - when you are stationedseveral thousand miles away serving your country in the middle of the desert.
Unexpected changes for transitioning wounded service members, like a decreasein stability once military pay ceases and disability benefits have yet to begin, alsothreaten families in our communities who have already sacrificed so much.

One of thehighlights of the week was hearing from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal(pictured above speaking on Sept. 24 in Oklahoma City).
Not only is Gov. Jindal one of the nation's leading champions of schoolchoice, but by refusing to go along with the Obamacare Medicaid expansionhe has reduced future federal spending by billions of dollars. Gov. Jindaland Oklahoma's own Sen. Tom Coburn continue to make the case that we
should not expand Medicaid.

It is customary, on Labor Day, to recall both the centrality of man to the
economy and
the inherent worth of work.
Inadvertently, because Labor Day is also a day on which Americansfrequently feast at a cookout, cruise on a lake or shop the sales, Labor Dayhas also recently become an annual occasion of self-pity and class envy.
It's easy to look at the neighbors' new grill, speedboat or full-price wardrobeand indulge the pangs of jealousy. Suddenly, Labor Day becomes less anopportunity to give gratitude for gainful employment than it is an opportunityto bemoan income inequality.

Today would have been the 101st birthday of Nobel Prize-winningeconomist Milton Friedman, who died in 2006 at the age of 94.
Friedman once observed that the explosive growth of homeschooling in thiscountry is "evidence of the failure of our current education system. There isno other complex field in our society in which do-it-yourself beats out factoryproduction or market production. Nobody makes his or her own car. But itstill is the case that parents can perform the job of educating their children,
in many cases better than our present education system."
It's not only
doctors and lawyers
who are joining the nation's fastest-growing
educational sector. Even some teachers, like Marcie Robbins of Bartlesville,are turning to homeschooling.

 The

yesterday
 
was
 
to
 
invite
 
AG

to
 
speak
 
at
 
our
 
October
 
17
Energy

in

 OCPA

energy

to
 
host
 
another
 
national
 
conference
 
on
 
energy
 
policy.
 
 We
 
appreciated
 
AG
Pruitt
 
being
 
involved
 
in
 
last
 
year’s
 
event,
 
and
 
we
 
sincerely
 
hope
 
he
 
is
 
available
 
to
 
participate
 
again
 
this
 
year.
 
 While
last
 
year’s
 
conference
 
focused
 
on
 
energy
 
and
 
federalism,
 
this
 
year
 
we
 
plan
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
how
 
energy
 
policy
 
impacts
families.
 
 
   
The
 
program
 
will
 
feature
 
panel
 
discussions,
 
an
 
awards
 
luncheon,
 
keynote
 
presentations,
 
and
 
legislative/litigation
updates
 
from
 
elected

policy
 
makers
 
at
 
both
 
the
 
state
 
and
 
federal
 
level.
 
 The
 
panels
 
and
 
presentations
are
 
designed
 
to
 
foster
 
dialogue
 
on
 
the
 
most
 
current
 
and
 
critical
 
energy
 
topics.
 
 The
 
Impact
 
Panel
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
the
impact
 
of
 
regulation
 
and
 
legislation
 
on
 
producers,
 
refinery
 
capacity/downstream
 
issues
 
and
 
why
 
they
 
matter,
property
 
rights,
 
how
 
policy
 
decisions
 
at
 
each
 
stage
 
impact
 
the
 
economics
 
of
 
energy,
 
and
 
what
 
it
 
all
 
means
 
to
consumers
 
at
 
the
 
pump
 
and
 
on
 
their
 
utility
 
bills.
 
 The
 
Regulatory
 
Panel
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
EPA’s
 
current
 
regional
 
haze
efforts,
 
the
 
adverse
 
impact
 
on
 
energy
 
companies,
 
the
 
science,
 
the
 
economics,
 
and
 
what
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
to
 
move
 
in
 
a
more
 
positive
 
direction.
 
 The
 
Tax
 
Panel
 
will
 
feature

to
 
have
 
AG
 
Pruitt
 
give
 
a
 
litigation
 
update
 
regarding
 
his
 
efforts
 
on
 
regional
 
haze,
 
etc.
 
 He
 
would
 
be
a
 
featured
 
speaker
 
rather
 
than
 
a

this
 
year. 
 
While
 
last
 
year’s
 
conference
 
focused
 
on
energy
 
and
 
federalism,
 
this
 
year
 
we
 
plan
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
how
 
energy
 
policy
 
impacts
 
families.
 
 
 
The
 
program
 
will
 
feature
 
panel
 
discussions,
 
an
 
awards
 
luncheon,
 
keynote
 
presentations,
 
and
legislative/litigation
 
updates
 
from
 
elected
 
officials
 
and
 
policy
 
makers
 
at
 
both
 
the
 
state
 
and
 
federal
level. 
 
The
 
panels
 
and
 
presentations
 
are
 
designed
 
to
 
foster
 
dialogue
 
on
 
the
 
most
 
current
 
and
 
critical
energy
 
topics. 
 
The
 
Impact
 
Panel
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
regulation
 
and
 
legislation
 
on
 
producers,
refinery
 
capacity/downstream
 
issues
 
and
 
why
 
they
 
matter,
 
property
 
rights,
 
how
 
policy
 
decisions
 
at
each
 
stage
 
impact
 
the
 
economics
 
of
 
energy,
 
and
 
what
 
it
 
all
 
means
 
to
 
consumers
 
at
 
the
 
pump
 
and
 
on
their
 
utility
 
bills. 
 
The
 
Regulatory
 
Panel
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
EPA’s
 
current
 
regional
 
haze
 
efforts,
 
the
adverse
 
impact
 
on
 
energy
 
companies,
 
the
 
science,
 
the
 
economics,
 
and
 
what
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
to
 
move
 
in
a
 
more
 
positive
 
direction. 
 
The
 
Tax
 
Panel
 
will
 
feature
 
an
 
important
 
discussion
 
on
 
energy
 
taxes
 
and
energy
 
tax
 
credits
 
and
 
best
 
free
 
market
 
practices
 
from
 
around
 
the
 
country. 
 
The
 
luncheon
 
will
feature
 
an
 
awards
 
ceremony
 
honoring
 
outstanding
 
pioneers
 
in
 
the
 
energy
 
industry,
 
including
 
a
special
 
award
 
for
 
women
 
in
 
energy.
 
Our
 
plan
 
would
 
be
 
to
 
have
 
AG
 
Pruitt
 
give
 
a
 
litigation
 
update
 
regarding
 
his
 
efforts
 
on
 
regional
 
haze,
etc. 
 
He
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
featured
 
speaker
 
rather
 
than
 
a
 
participant
 
on
 
a
 
panel. 
 
Please
 
let
 
me
 
know
 
if
 
you
have
 
any
 
questions
 
about
 
this
 
project. 
 
AG
 
Pruitt
 
may
 
also
 
be
 
interested
 
to
 
know
 
that,
 
while
 
the
energy
 
conference
 
will
 
take
 
place
 
during
 
the
 
day
 
on
 
the
 
17th,
 
we
 
are
 
hosting
 
our
 
annual
 
Liberty
 
Gala
that
 
same
 
evening
 
as
 
a
 
separate
 
event. 
 
The
 
keynote
 
speaker
 
will
 
be
 
George
 
W.
 
Bush,
 
and
 
Scott
would
 
of
 
course
 
be
 
welcome
 
to
 
stay
 
for
 
the
 
banquet
 
if
 
he
 
would
 
like.

Thank you
Recently, a new acquaintance helpfully offered me a list of "free" events inOklahoma City and hospitably urged me to unite with her as she attendedthem.
"Join this young adult group," she urged. "So far, we've gone to a freeThunder game and a free happy hour. This week, we're going to a freeRedhawks game."
Later, she texted me to tell me the Myriad Gardens occasionally offers "free"movie nights.
The exchanges were redolent of conversations I used to have with cannyclassmates in college. My savviest friends could blithely articulate how a
shrewd student could eat for "free" every night of the week.

Truly reforming education
By Michael Carnuccio
Let's reflect on a public policy battle that has created quite a stiraround the country and will most assuredly do so through thepivotal election year that approaches.
Feb-17-2017 005086
First, support for common core standards is misguided. On the surface, theapproach to increase student achievement by establishing a higher bar as the floorfor common education seems noteworthy. The concept of ensuring that no child inany school district in any state is being educated at a lower level than his peer inanother school district of another state seems noble as well.
Unfortunately, this line of thinking misses the point of why the status quo issubstandard - the more we have shifted power and authority of education towardthe federal government, the worse our education system and product has become.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that since the creation of the federalDepartment of Education student performance has at best flat-lined while costshave skyrocketed.

The concept of ensuring that no child inany school district in any state is being educated at a lower level than his peer inanother school district of another state seems noble as well.
Unfortunately, this line of thinking misses the point of why the status quo issubstandard - the more we have shifted power and authority of education towardthe federal government, the worse our education system and product has become.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that since the creation of the federalDepartment of Education student performance has at best flat-lined while costshave skyrocketed.

Energy ConferenceMelissa,
I hope you are doing well.
 The reason for my call yesterday was to invite AG Pruitt to
speak at our October 17 Energy Conference in Tulsa.
 OCPA is partnering with Energy
Advocates, a non-profit energy education organization founded by Mark Stansberry
and others, to host another national conference on energy policy.
 We appreciated
AG Pruitt being involved in last year’s event, and we sincerely hope he is available to
participate again this year.
 While last year’s conference focused on energy and
federalism, this year we plan to focus on how energy policy impacts families.
The program will feature panel discussions, an awards luncheon, keynotepresentations, and legislative/litigation updates from elected officials and policy
makers at both the state and federal level.
 The panels and presentations are
designed to foster dialogue on the most current and critical energy topics.
 The
Feb-17-2017 005092
Impact Panel will focus on the impact of regulation and legislation on producers,
refinery capacity/downstream issues and why they matter, property rights, howpolicy decisions at each stage impact the economics of energy, and what it all means
to consumers at the pump and on their utility bills.
 The Regulatory Panel will focus
on the EPA’s current regional haze efforts, the adverse impact on energy companies,the science, the economics, and what can be done to move in a more positive
direction.
 The Tax Panel will feature an important discussion on energy taxes and
energy tax credits and best free market practices from around the country.
 The
luncheon will feature an awards ceremony honoring outstanding pioneers in theenergy industry, including a special award for women in energy.
Our plan would be to have AG Pruitt give a litigation update regarding his efforts on
regional haze, etc.
 He would be a featured speaker rather than a participant on a
panel.
 Please let me know if you have any questions about this project.
 AG Pruitt
may also be interested to know that, while the energy conference will take placeduring the day on the 17th, we are hosting our annual Liberty Gala that same
evening as a separate event.
 The keynote speaker will be George W. Bush, and Scott
would of course be welcome to stay for the banquet if he would like.

Shut it down
By Michael Carnuccio
I'm not sure shutdown is the right term. Remember, 83 percent ofthe federal government is still operating and the U.S. is on course to spend more
Feb-17-2017 005116
than $3.5 trillion. Essentially, we're no longer allowed to visit open-air parks and
war memorials because career politicians can't agree on how to spend money theydon't have.
I joined leaders from several state-based, grass-roots organizations across thecountry to issue an open letter to each member of the Congress:
The great historian and lecturer, Dr. J. Rufus Fears, distilled knowledge of the ageswhen he wrote that a nation "cannot live with a tremendous debt for a long periodof time. ... We must cut government spending." In the masterful constitutionaldesign, the U.S. House (of Representatives) was designed to be the most powerfulelement of Congress, and the best means to curb executive or judicial abuse. Asthe element in our Federalist political system closest to the people, only the Housecan slow down and even stop the pell-mell rush to fiscal ruin flowing from theExecutive Branch and its allies in the Senate.

Cut waste and pay teachers
By Michael Carnuccio
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Janet Barresi hassuggested giving Oklahoma schoolteachers a $2,000 pay raise, funded with a
Feb-17-2017 005130
combination of school district carry-over funds and a 2-percent reduction in
administrative overhead.
I applaud Barresi's idea of using existing money to fund pay hikes. Achievingefficiencies in an organization can result in employees receiving better pay forbetter performance. Organizations routinely decide to realign expendituresinternally to reallocate resources to employees who are more deserving.
Lord knows there are efficiencies to be found in common education. The dramaticgrowth and bloat in administration is well-documented. When Oklahoma has nearlyas many non-teachers as teachers, something is wrong.

More specifically, Oklahoma Wesleyandoes not provide its employees with health insurance covering post-fertilization abortifacient drugs that, by definition, can and often do terminatepregnancy.

Obamacare continues to fail

Liberty is gaining ground
Vedder vs. Obama on
higher-ed policy
Forward the cause:
Last week Oklahomans received the
news
that Obamacare will increase
premiums in Oklahoma. Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doakmade the announcement after insurance companies filed their policy ratesto be offered in the federal exchange.
Staunch advocates of Obamacare have been upset with the facts. While thenews released by Commissioner Doak and the Insurance Departmentdoesn't fit their narrative, this increase in premiums should not be a surprise.The previous insurance commissioner, Kim Holland, and numerous otherswarned of the flaws in Obamacare that were going to result in these sorts of
premium increases. Even
Barack Obama's own administration
has admitted
some will see premium increases because of Obamacare.

We would love to have the AG attend. 
Just didn't want to impose to heavily on his
 schedule, but with his support of the Lindsey Nicole Scholarships it would be fitting for you guys to join us.
Let me know.
