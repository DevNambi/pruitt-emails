Rich,
General Pruitt asked that I email you and put you in contact with Clayton
Eubanks, Deputy Solicitor General. Clayton is who would handle issues
such as RFS and Ozone NAAQS which you all discussed at the
meeting in DC.
I have included Clayton in this email as way of introduction. Thank you
again for the information you provided during General Pruitt's visit and
please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else we can do
for you.
Best,

Hi, Clayton - I hope you and your family survived the tornadoes without incident. We are
certainly thinking of you and your fellow Oklahomans. I assumed things would be quite
hectic, so was going to wait a few days before I reached out to you. However, I am now out of
the office on maternity leave, but we certainly still want to update you on our issues. It may be
easiest for you to setup a time with Rich and Dave - they will be able to provide you with the
information General Pruitt is interested in.

Rich,
General Pruitt asked that I email you and put you in contact with Clayton Eubanks, Deputy Solicitor
General. Clayton is who would handle issues such as RFS and Ozone NAAQS which you all discussed at
the meeting in DC.
I have included Clayton in this email as way of introduction. Thank you again for the information you
provided during General Pruitt's visit and please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else we
can do for you.
Best,
Ashley

work for a phone call tomorrow (Monday)?  If so, let us know which time works best

Hi, Clayton - I hope you and your family survived the tornadoes without incident.
We are certainly thinking of you and your fellow Oklahomans. I assumed things
would be quite hectic, so was going to wait a few days before I reached out to
you. However, I am now out of the office on maternity leave, but we certainly still
want to update you on our issues. It may be easiest for you to setup a time with
Rich and Dave - they will be able to provide you with the information General
Pruitt is interested in.
Thanks!

Hi, Clayton - I hope you and your family survived the tornadoes without incident. We are
certainly thinking of you and your fellow Oklahomans. I assumed things would be quite
hectic, so was going to wait a few days before I reached out to you. However, I am now out of
the office on maternity leave, but we certainly still want to update you on our issues. It may be
easiest for you to setup a time with Rich and Dave - they will be able to provide you with the

Hi, Clayton - I hope you and your family survived the tornadoes without
incident. We are certainly thinking of you and your fellow Oklahomans. I
assumed things would be quite hectic, so was going to wait a few days

NEED YOUR HELP WITH FUNDRAISER TO PROTECT KIDS
05/13/2013 06:43 PM
Childhelp WFC_Golf_Tournament.pdf
ChildHelp_Sponsor_Credit Card Authorization Form.pdf

Dear Friends,
M’Liss and I are very excited to announce the start of an annual golf
tournament to raise funds for Childhelp, Wasatch Front Utah Chapter.  The
goal is to raise enough funds so that we can support the Speak Up Be
Safe program and the Art in a Bag program.
The Speak Up Be Safe program is a, school-based, child abuse
prevention education program that focuses on child safety. This
program was developed by National ChildHelp Foundation and has
been successfully taught nationwide and is now a mandatory program
in all Florida State elementary schools. Riverton Elementary is the
first school in the state in which we have been able to implement this
program. It was very successful and the SUBS program is being
requested by other local elementary schools. Our goal is to raise
enough funds to roll this program out to an additional 5 schools in
2013, and eventually roll the program out statewide.
The Art in the Bag program is a local ChildHelp program founded by
my wife M’Liss, in which art supplies are purchased/donated to fill
knapsacks that are then donated to local centers providing services
for displaced children and those recovering from abuse. The child
keeps the bag and art supplies and takes it with them when they are
placed into their next living environment.
Please consider joing us in sponsoring our golf tournament at Crater
Springs Golf Course on June 27, 2013. Your support is greatly appreciated
and will go a long way in helping us reach our fundraising goal and thereby
helping and protecting children.
Please find attached a sponsorship form.

Feb-17-2017 002755

Front, Utah Chapter. For further information, you can visit our website at

Please find attached a short white paper with some talking points that you might find
useful to cut and paste when encouraging States to file comments on the SSM rule. I
am also attaching a summary of those comments as filed by States into the docket.
The bulk of these request an extension. Five have submitted substantive comments

Finally, I am attaching the earlier comments filed by Devon which also focuses on the

We are under no pressure here.  Quite the opposite, we want to take the time to get this paper
right, and we appreciate your expertise on the Farrell-Cooper and FOIA paragraphs.  The end of this

Dear Friends,
M’Liss and I are very excited to announce the start of an annual golf
tournament to raise funds for Childhelp, Wasatch Front Utah Chapter.  The
goal is to raise enough funds so that we can support the Speak Up Be
Safe program and the Art in a Bag program.
The Speak Up Be Safe program is a, school-based, child abuse
prevention education program that focuses on child safety. This
program was developed by National ChildHelp Foundation and has
been successfully taught nationwide and is now a mandatory program
in all Florida State elementary schools. Riverton Elementary is the
first school in the state in which we have been able to implement this
program. It was very successful and the SUBS program is being
requested by other local elementary schools. Our goal is to raise
enough funds to roll this program out to an additional 5 schools in
2013, and eventually roll the program out statewide.
The Art in the Bag program is a local ChildHelp program founded by
my wife M’Liss, in which art supplies are purchased/donated to fill
knapsacks that are then donated to local centers providing services
for displaced children and those recovering from abuse. The child
keeps the bag and art supplies and takes it with them when they are
placed into their next living environment.
Please consider joing us in sponsoring our golf tournament at Crater
Springs Golf Course on June 27, 2013. Your support is greatly appreciated
and will go a long way in helping us reach our fundraising goal and thereby
helping and protecting children.
Please find attached a sponsorship form.
