informed
intuition
 
as

consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 002997
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon
sense”
 
and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
 
Luck!

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23:07 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
 
intuition
 
as
 
to
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
 
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
 
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
 
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
“common”,
 
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
 
is
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
 
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
 
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
 
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
 
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
their
 
papers.
 
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
 
law.
 
I
 
would
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
 
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
 
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
 
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
 
(again
 
no
 
pun
 
intended)
 
as
 
the
 
chief
 
“legal”
 
officers
 
of
 
their
 
respective
 
jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
 
concerned
 
with
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
 
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
 
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
 
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
 
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you

Spring

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003003
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you

Spring

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003006
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon
sense”
 
and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
 
Luck!

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003009
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon
sense”
 
and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
 
Luck!

proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003012
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon
sense”
 
and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
 
Luck!

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.

Feb-17-2017 003015
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon
sense”
 
and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
 
Luck!

Dear Former Attorneys General,
Feb-17-2017 003025
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating

will
make

Please

I

Your

so

send
the

 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.

this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the

There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the

so
please

me

 By
the

Grant

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is
on
the
Forum
Board
of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking
out
on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much
for
your
consideration
 Lynne

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
Feb-17-2017 003060
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is
on
the

Board
of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking
out
on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much
for
your
consideration

write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former

Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the

few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is

Grant

Terry
have

Dear Former Attorneys General,
Feb-17-2017 003072
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach

former

Bob
Stephan's

this
week
at
a
Kansas

the

There
are
likely

be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is
on
the

of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking

Thanks
so

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
Feb-17-2017 003078
both through a former AG letter, as well as the  one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I

opportunities

if
you

 By
the

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
Feb-17-2017 003086
both through a former AG letter, as well as the  one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also

this
week
at
a

There

lots
of

roots
opportunities
to

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Feb-17-2017 003092
Your name will be listed with your state and years in office so please send the years!  Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also

this

There
are

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Feb-17-2017 003100
Your name will be listed with your state and years in office so please send the years!  Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is
on
the
Forum
Board
of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking
out
on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much
for
your
consideration

I have been working with Grant, Terry and Mark for the past several yearsin encouraging Congress to act. Those in the know believe that the lawenforcement perspective provided both through a former AG letter, as
well as the 
one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will make a difference.
Please feel free to call one of us if you want to talk further about this. I
also attach 
below former AG Bob Stephan's comments this week at a
Kansas City roundtable coordinated by the National Immigration Forum.There are likely to be lots of grass roots opportunities to speak on thistopic in the next few months so please let me know if you would like to
become more involved. 
By the way, Mark Shurtleff is on the Forum Board
of Directors. Grant and Terry have 
also been very active in speaking out
on immigration issues. 
Thanks so much for your considerationLynne

Subject:imp't new class cert decisionDate:04/16/2013 10:46 AMLast Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a major decision vacating a classcertification order in an institutional reform case (alleging systemic deficiencies remediable bystructural injunctions) that possesses salient characteristics parallel to the foster care suits we
confront.
 Details regarding the case can be found here (and note the internal hyperlink to the D.C.
Circuit’s decision):
http://tinyurl.com/c8g4yzk
 In effect, the D.C. Circuit, relying on 
Wal-Mart
, has held that proof of systemic deficiencies, or thatall class members have suffered a violation of the same provision of law, may be insufficient tosustain a broad class action; instead, the trial court must link a precise policy or practice that affectsall members of the class in near-identical fashion to common harm remediable through a single
injunction.
 As bad as they may be, disparate failures to achieve important, legally-mandated
objectives – as opposed to a single or uniform policy or practice that bridges all class-members’
claims – will not satisfy Rule 23. 
Even if a uniformly-applied, destructive policy or practice is
identified, “the requested relief must respond, at least in part, to a common harm suffered as aresult of [the] policy or practice that affects each class member.”
One thing remarkable to me about this decision is that the D.C. Circuit was willing to decertify a classthat had been certified in 2006 – even after final findings of liability and injunctions ordering relief to
the class had entered.
 The Circuit remanded the case for reconsideration of whether subclasses (or
separate classes in a consolidated case) could be certified “and, if so, thereafter to redetermine
liability and appropriate relief.”
 So while I’m sure Texas, RI, and my state will be eager to cite this
decision, I think everyone might find it interesting.
This decision follows on the heels of another favorable Circuit decision of interest to the subset of usfacing claims that a State is failing to comply with federal law in reimbursing providers the costs of
foster care:
Midwest Foster Care & Adoption Ass'n v. Kincade
, 12-1834, 2013 WL 1394975 (8th Cir.
Apr. 8, 2013).
 That decision holds that 
federal law does not give providers a privately enforceableright under § 1983 to foster care maintenance payments from the state.

Would General Pruitt have some time in his schedule over the next few days to speak with Ashley by phone, given
that he won’t be attending the event in DC? 
I think he’d only need about 15 minutes.

FW: General Pruitt's Schedule  Ashley,
Would General Pruitt have some time in his schedule over the next few days to speak with Ashley by phone, given
that he won’t be attending the event in DC? 
I think he’d only need about 15 minutes.

'Subject: General Pruitt's Schedule
Ashley,
As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I work with Ashley Taylor who works frequently with General Pruitt. 
He
asked that I determine whether General Pruitt would be in attendance at General 
Gansler’s summit 
(“Privacy in the
Digital Age”) being held in Washington, DC, on April 14 – 16. 
Could you let me know whether he plans to be there? 
Thank you for your assistance!

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003262
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23:07 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
 
intuition
 
as
 
to
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
 
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
 
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
 
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
“common”,
 
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
 
is
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
 
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
 
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
 
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
 
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
their
 
papers.
 
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
 
law.
 
I
 
would
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
 
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
 
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
 
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
 
(again
 
no
 
pun
 
intended)
 
as
 
the
 
chief
 
“legal”
 
officers
 
of
 
their
 
respective
 
jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
 
concerned
 
with
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
 
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
 
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
 
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
 
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
 
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon

and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
Luck!

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference.
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is
on
the
Forum
Board
of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking
out
on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much
for
your
consideration
Lynne

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003268
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon
sense”
 
and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
 
Luck!

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003271
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon
sense”
 
and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
 
Luck!

it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to

to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003274
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
blooming
 
of
 
“uncommon
sense”
 
and
 
will
 
alert
 
you
 
should
 
I
 
discern
 
any
 
such
 
exotic
 
flower.
 
Good
 
Luck!

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.

Subject:Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration ReformDate:04/08/2013 11:23 AM 
 
 
Lynn,
   
 
Allow
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
following
 
observations
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
your
 
recent
 
e-mail:
1.
I
 
have
 
come
 
to
 
dislike
 
the
 
phrase
 
“common
 
sense.”
 
Contrary
 
to
 
my
 
hopefully
 
informed
intuition
 
as
 
to
 
consequences,
 
almost
 
everything
 
President
 
Obama
 
proposes
 
these
 
days
 
is
“common
 
sense”,
 
eg.,
 
“common
 
sense
 
health
 
coverage,
 
common
 
sense
 
immigration
reform,
 
you
 
name
 
it.”
 
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
phrase
 
is
 
being
 
utilized
 
so
 
often
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
become
 
trite;
one
 
should
 
also
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
Webster’s,
 
among
 
other
 
meanings
 
of
 
“common”,
defines
 
the
 
term
 
as
 
conveying
 
“second
 
rate.”
 
What
 
is
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
immigration
 
debate
is
 
“uncommon
 
sense”,
 
a
 
commodity
 
currently
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
supply
 
in
 
Washington.
 
I
would
 
rename
 
your
 
e-mail
 
as
 
stated
 
above.
2.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
letter
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
phrase
 
“undocumented”.
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
Liberal
urge
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
euphemism,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
always
 
thought
 
it
 
better
 
to
 
call
 
a
 
spade
 
a
 
spade.
 
In
this
 
instance
 
the
 
semantically
 
accurate
 
term
 
is
 
“illegal”.
 
The
 
overwhelming
 
majority
 
of
the
 
11
 
million
 
“illegals”
 
in
 
this
 
country
 
are
 
not
 
victims
 
of
 
administrative
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
part
of
 
ICE
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
agency.
 
Nor
 
are
 
they
 
individuals
 
who
 
have
 
simply
 
lost
 
their
 
papers.
Instead
 
they
 
are
 
persons
 
who,
 
with
 
their
 
families,
 
have
 
deliberately
 
violated
 
American
law.
 
I
 
would
 
insert
 
“illegal”
 
wherever
 
“undocumented”
 
appears
 
in
 
your
 
e-mail.
3.
a.
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
we
 
AG’s
 
and
 
former
 
AG’s
 
like
 
to
 
refer
 
to
 
ourselves
 
as
 
being
 
or
 
having
been
 
the
 
chief
 
“law
 
enforcement”
 
officers
 
in
 
our
 
States.
 
This
 
sounds
 
good
 
on
 
the
campaign
 
trail
 
but,
 
except
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
instances,
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
true.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
proposition
(no
 
pun
 
intended),
 
we
 
should
 
resist
 
this
 
temptation
 
and
 
instead
 
refer
 
to
 
AG’s
 
generically
Feb-17-2017 003280
(again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b.
 
To
 
avoid
 
the
 
inference
 
that,
 
despite
 
prior
 
affirmations,
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
 
much
 
more
concerned
 
with
 
“comprehensive
 
immigration
 
reform”
 
than
 
“increased
 
border
 
security”,
 
I
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
rewrite
 
of
 
your
 
last
 
two
 
sentences:
  
 
“Put
 
simply,
 
practical
 
reform
 
to
 
our
 
federal
 
immigration
 
laws
 
which
 
addresses
 
both
issues
 
will
 
make
 
us
 
all
 
safer.”
  
 
“We
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
expeditiously
 
with
 
consideration
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
such
 
reform
legislation.”
 
 
Please
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
these
 
observations
 
as
 
critical
 
of
 
your
 
enterprise.
 
If
 
the
 
foregoing
 
changes
were
 
made
 
I
 
would
 
sign
 
your
 
letter,
 
but
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
probably
 
not
 
feasible.
 
Since,
 
as
 
you
know,
 
Spring
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
Washington,
 
I
 
will
 
begin
 
a

for
 
a

you
 
should
 
I

any
 
such
 
exotic

Luck!

members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is
on
the
Forum
Board
of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking
out
on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much
for
your
consideration

Dear Former Attorneys General,
Feb-17-2017 003290
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is
on
the
Forum
Board
of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking
out
on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much
for
your
consideration

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is

the

of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking

on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much
for
your
consideration

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
Feb-17-2017 003339
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas

roundtable
coordinated
by
the
National
Immigration
Forum.
There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the
next
few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is
on
the

Board
of
Directors.
Grant
and
Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking

on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much

your
consideration

please
get

me
by

9
if
you

I
hope
to
get
the

on
April
10.
Your

will
be
listed
with
your
state

so
please
send
the

 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call

us
if
you
want
to
talk

about
this.

lots
of

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
both
through
a
former
AG
letter,
as
well
as
the
 one
circulating
through
NAAG/CWAG
will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach
 below
former
AG
Bob
Stephan's
comments
this
week
at
a
Kansas
City
roundtable
coordinated

the

There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in
the

few
months
so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would

like to become more involved.  By the way, Mark Shurtleff is on the Forum Board of Directors. Grant and Terry
have
 also
been
very
active
in
speaking
out
on
immigration
issues.
Thanks
so
much
for
your
consideration

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
Feb-17-2017 003359
both through a former AG letter, as well as the  one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.

Dear
Former
Attorneys
General,
On
behalf
of
former
AGs
Terry
Goddard,
Mark
Shurtleff
and
Grant
Woods,
I
write
to
ask
you
to
join
 in
signing
on
to
this
letter
(see
attached)
 conveying
to
Senate
and
House
leadership
and
members
support
for
legislative
efforts
to
pass
common
sense
immigration
reform
in
conjunction
with
increased
border
security.
 Could
you
please
get
back
to
me
by
Tuesday,
April
9
if
you
want
to
sign
on.
I
hope
to
get
the
letter
to
the
Hill
on
April
10.
Your
name
will
be
listed
with
your
state
and
years
in
office
so
please
send
the
years!
 Thanks
I
have
been
working
with
Grant,
Terry
and
Mark
for
the
past
several
years
in
encouraging
Congress
to
act.
Those
in
the
know
believe
that
the
law
enforcement
perspective
provided
Feb-17-2017 003367
both through a former AG letter, as well as the  one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will
make
a
difference. 
Please
feel
free
to
call
one
of
us
if
you
want
to
talk
further
about
this.
I
also
attach

Stephan's

this
week
at
a
Kansas

roundtable
coordinated

There
are
likely
to
be
lots
of
grass
roots
opportunities
to
speak
on
this
topic
in

so
please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
become
more
involved.
 By
the
way,
Mark
Shurtleff
is

Grant

have

issues.

join 
in signing on to this letter (see attached) 
conveying to Senate and House leadership and
members support for legislative efforts to pass common sense immigration reform in
conjunction with increased border security. 
Could you please get back to me by Tuesday, April
9 if you want to sign on. I hope to get the letter to the Hill on April 10.
Your name will be listed with your state and years in office so please send the years! 
Thanks
I have been working with Grant, Terry and Mark for the past several years in encouragingCongress to act. Those in the know believe that the law enforcement perspective provided
both through a former AG letter, as well as the 
one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will make
a difference.
Please feel free to call one of us if you want to talk further about this. I also attach 
below
former AG Bob Stephan's comments this week at a Kansas City roundtable coordinated by theNational Immigration Forum. There are likely to be lots of grass roots opportunities to speakon this topic in the next few months so please let me know if you would like to become more
involved. 
By the way, Mark Shurtleff is on the Forum Board of Directors. Grant and Terry have
also been very active in speaking out on immigration issues.

I have been working with Grant, Terry and Mark for the past several yearsin encouraging Congress to act. Those in the know believe that the lawenforcement perspective provided both through a former AG letter, as
well as the 
one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will make a difference.
Please feel free to call one of us if you want to talk further about this. I
also attach 
below former AG Bob Stephan's comments this week at a
Kansas City roundtable coordinated by the National Immigration Forum.There are likely to be lots of grass roots opportunities to speak on thistopic in the next few months so please let me know if you would like to
become more involved. 
By the way, Mark Shurtleff is on the Forum Board
of Directors. Grant and Terry have 
also been very active in speaking out
on immigration issues. 
Thanks so much for your considerationLynne

Hello everyone.
 DOJ will provide the response for EPA/the United States on the question of
service via email, but in the meantime I am requesting that you remove Brenda Mallory from
your email lists, and add Patricia Embrey and David Orlin (both cc'd here).
 Thank you, Carol

 Responding in the future to

EPA has asked me to ask each of you to remove Acting General Counsel Brenda Mallory (

I believe she is being inundated.
 Responding in the future to

EPA has asked me to ask each of you to remove Acting General Counsel Brenda Mallory (
Mallory.brenda@epa.gov
) from your email
list for this case. 
I believe she is being inundated.
 Responding in the future to 
this email, rather than the initial one from JonathanMitchell, will do the trick.

All –
EPA has asked me to ask each of you to remove Acting General Counsel Brenda Mallory (
Mallory.brenda@epa.gov
) from your email
list for this case. 
I believe she is being inundated.
 Responding in the future to 
this email, rather than the initial one from JonathanMitchell, will do the trick.
Many thanks, and best regards to each of you.Tom Lorenzen

 I would like to clarify that this agreement applies to

 to those that will be filed later this month.
On behalf of the Utility Air Regulatory Group, we consent to email service.

EPA has asked me to ask each of you to remove Acting General Counsel Brenda Mallory (

I believe she is being inundated.
 Responding in the future to

I believe she is being inundated.

Subject:RE: GHG service via e-mailDate:04/18/2013 12:14 AMThose of you who know me won’t be surprised to hear that my heart is still in this case, even though
I no longer have the honor of representing truth, justice, and Texas.
 If I could receive a copy of your

Subject:imp't new class cert decisionDate:04/16/2013 10:46 AMLast Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a major decision vacating a classcertification order in an institutional reform case (alleging systemic deficiencies remediable bystructural injunctions) that possesses salient characteristics parallel to the foster care suits we
confront.
 Details regarding the case can be found here (and note the internal hyperlink to the D.C.
Circuit’s decision):
http://tinyurl.com/c8g4yzk
 In effect, the D.C. Circuit, relying on 
Wal-Mart
, has held that proof of systemic deficiencies, or thatall class members have suffered a violation of the same provision of law, may be insufficient tosustain a broad class action; instead, the trial court must link a precise policy or practice that affectsall members of the class in near-identical fashion to common harm remediable through a single
injunction.
 As bad as they may be, disparate failures to achieve important, legally-mandated
objectives – as opposed to a single or uniform policy or practice that bridges all class-members’
claims – will not satisfy Rule 23. 
Even if a uniformly-applied, destructive policy or practice is
identified, “the requested relief must respond, at least in part, to a common harm suffered as aresult of [the] policy or practice that affects each class member.”
One thing remarkable to me about this decision is that the D.C. Circuit was willing to decertify a classthat had been certified in 2006 – even after final findings of liability and injunctions ordering relief to
the class had entered.
 The Circuit remanded the case for reconsideration of whether subclasses (or
separate classes in a consolidated case) could be certified “and, if so, thereafter to redetermine
liability and appropriate relief.”
 So while I’m sure Texas, RI, and my state will be eager to cite this
decision, I think everyone might find it interesting.
This decision follows on the heels of another favorable Circuit decision of interest to the subset of usfacing claims that a State is failing to comply with federal law in reimbursing providers the costs of
foster care:
Midwest Foster Care & Adoption Ass'n v. Kincade
, 12-1834, 2013 WL 1394975 (8th Cir.
Apr. 8, 2013).
 That decision holds that 
federal law does not give providers a privately enforceableright under § 1983 to foster care maintenance payments from the state.

Last Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a major decision vacating a class
Feb-17-2017 003482
certification order in an institutional reform case (alleging systemic deficiencies remediable by
structural injunctions) that possesses salient characteristics parallel to the foster care suits we
confront.
 Details regarding the case can be found here (and note the internal hyperlink to the D.C.
Circuit’s decision):
http://tinyurl.com/c8g4yzk
 In effect, the D.C. Circuit, relying on 
Wal-Mart
, has held that proof of systemic deficiencies, or thatall class members have suffered a violation of the same provision of law, may be insufficient tosustain a broad class action; instead, the trial court must link a precise policy or practice that affectsall members of the class in near-identical fashion to common harm remediable through a single
injunction.
 As bad as they may be, disparate failures to achieve important, legally-mandated
objectives – as opposed to a single or uniform policy or practice that bridges all class-members’
claims – will not satisfy Rule 23. 
Even if a uniformly-applied, destructive policy or practice is
identified, “the requested relief must respond, at least in part, to a common harm suffered as aresult of [the] policy or practice that affects each class member.”
One thing remarkable to me about this decision is that the D.C. Circuit was willing to decertify a classthat had been certified in 2006 – even after final findings of liability and injunctions ordering relief to
the class had entered.
 The Circuit remanded the case for reconsideration of whether subclasses (or
separate classes in a consolidated case) could be certified “and, if so, thereafter to redetermine
liability and appropriate relief.”
 So while I’m sure Texas, RI, and my state will be eager to cite this
decision, I think everyone might find it interesting.
This decision follows on the heels of another favorable Circuit decision of interest to the subset of usfacing claims that a State is failing to comply with federal law in reimbursing providers the costs of
foster care:
Midwest Foster Care & Adoption Ass'n v. Kincade
, 12-1834, 2013 WL 1394975 (8th Cir.
Apr. 8, 2013).
 That decision holds that 
federal law does not give providers a privately enforceableright under § 1983 to foster care maintenance payments from the state.

It
was
a
pleasure
speaking
with
you
about
our
client
Midland
Credit
Management. 
As
I
mentioned
during
our
call,
Troutman
Sanders
is
working
with
the
Illinois
Attorney
General’s
office
to
organize
a
multi-state
effort
on
behalf
of
our
client,
Midland
Credit
Management
and
its
parent
company,
Encore
Capital
Group. 
As
you
may
know,
Midland
is
one
of
the
industry
leaders
in
the
debt
buyer/collection
industry.  
Midland
buys
portfolios
of
accounts
from
established
credit
issuers,
such
as
Chase,
Bank
of
America,
and
Wells
Fargo
and
partners
with
individuals
as
they
repay
their
obligations
and
work
toward
financial
recovery.
The
multi-state
effort
is
designed
to
permit
Midland
to
address
the
collective
concerns
of
the
state
attorneys
general
in
a
comprehensive
manner. 
It
is
our
hope
that
a
multi-state
action
will
result
in
consistency
across
the
states
as
to
how
consumers
are
treated. 
We
believe
this
effort
is
particularly
timely,
given
the
existing
NAAG
working
group
that
is
focused
on
the
debt
collection
industry
as
well
as
the
other
recently-announced
agreement
between
nineteen
states
and
another
company
in
the
same
industry.   
To
date, 
38
states
have
agreed
to
join
this
effort. 
This
process
is
being
led
by
Illinois
Assistant
Attorney
General
Jeff
Feltman. 
His

information
is

thus
far
has
been
collegial.

 Ashley, Would General Pruitt have some time in his schedule over the next few days to speak with Ashley by
phone, given that he won’t be attending the e= vent in DC? 
I think he’d only need about 15 minutes.
Thanks!

Would General Pruitt have some time in his schedule over the next few days to speak with Ashley by
phone, given that he won’t be attending the e= vent in DC? 
I think he’d only need about 15 minutes.

 Ashley, Would General Pruitt have some time in his schedule over the next few days to speak with Ashley by

I think he’d only need about 15 minutes.

FW: General Pruitt's Schedule  Ashley,
Would General Pruitt have some time in his schedule over the next few days to speak with Ashley by phone, given
that he won’t be attending the event in DC? 
I think he’d only need about 15 minutes.

Ashley,
As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I work with Ashley Taylor who works frequently with General Pruitt. 
He
asked that I determine whether General Pruitt would be in attendance at General 
Gansler’s summit 
(“Privacy in the
Digital Age”) being held in Washington, DC, on April 14 – 16. 
Could you let me know whether he plans to be there?

Ashley,
Would General Pruitt have some time in his schedule over the next few days to speak with Ashley by phone, given
that he won’t be attending the event in DC? 
I think he’d only need about 15 minutes.

Ashley,
As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I work with Ashley Taylor who works frequently with General Pruitt. 
He
asked that I determine whether General Pruitt would be in attendance at General 
Gansler’s summit 
(“Privacy in the
Digital Age”) being held in Washington, DC, on April 14 – 16. 
Could you let me know whether he plans to be there? 
Thank you for your assistance!

I think he’d only need about 15 minutes. 
Thanks!

Ashley,
As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I work with Ashley Taylor who works frequently with General Pruitt. 
He
asked that I determine whether General Pruitt would be in attendance at General 
Gansler’s summit 
(“Privacy in the
Digital Age”) being held in Washington, DC, on April 14 – 16. 
Could you let me know whether he plans to be there? 
Thank you for your assistance!

Ashley,
As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I work with Ashley Taylor who works frequently with General Pruitt. 
He
asked that I determine whether General Pruitt would be in attendance at General 
Gansler’s summit 
(“Privacy in the
Digital Age”) being held in Washington, DC, on April 14 – 16. 
Could you let me know whether he plans to be there? 
Thank you for your assistance!

(“Privacy in the Digital Age”) being held in Washington, DC, on April 14 – 16.
Could you let me know whether he plans to be there? 
Thank you for your assistance!

Wall Street Journal: Using 'Sue and Settle' to Thwart Oil and Gas Drillers
In Case You Missed It
Using 'Sue and Settle' to Thwart Oiland Gas Drillers The Endangered Species Act is being employedmore than ever to block development. By 
STEPHEN MOORE
Oklahoma City Last week the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and an environmentaladvocacy group agreed to a legal settlement that will place nine species—includingthe Panama City crayfish, moccasinshell mussel and boreal toad—on the fast track forplacement on the endangered species list. It is only the latest of many such listings.The Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned Fish and Wildlife to designate some
Feb-17-2017 003600
250 species as endangered since 2008. Many of CBD's petitions—and lawsuits—are
still in the pipeline. About 97% of the species that are designated as endangerednever move off the list.Next March, Fish and Wildlife will make a determination about whether to add thelesser prairie chicken, found in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Kansas to the list.Harold Hamm, president of Continental Resources, says that the habitat for theprairie chicken overlaps "some of the most promising land for oil and gas leases inthe country."Many Westerners suspect that this environmental activism isn't only or even mostlyabout saving species and obscure subspecies. Instead, it is about restricting land useon hundreds of thousands of acres of private and state land. The concern is that ifthese species are listed as endangered, their habitat could be placed off limits foreconomic development.In the 1980s, environmentalists successfully used a listing of the Northern SpottedOwl as threatened to cripple the timber industry in Oregon and Washington, throwingmany thousands out of jobs. This is the playbook now being used by groups like theCBD—which boasts on its website of its desire to end most oil and gas production inthe United States.Since taking office, the Obama administration and its green allies inside and outsidefederal agencies have been making expanded use of a tactic called "sue and settle"to issue new and expensive regulations. Groups like CBD and WildEarth Guardians,for example, petition Fish and Wildlife to list a species as endangered. Otherenvironmental groups use a similar tactic to get new water and air regulations fromthe Environmental Protection Agency. Then, sometimes the very same day, theenvironmental groups file a lawsuit against Fish and Wildlife or the EPA to force thegovernment to act—arguing that the regulatory process is too slow.Amos Eno, a former Fish and Wildlife Service official who worked to save the grizzlybear and the condor, is critical of the tactic. Mr. Eno, who now runs Resources First,says the money wasted on these lawsuits could be used on conservation efforts toactually save species from extinction.Because the federal agencies include former employees of green organizations, sueand settle can be a collaborative, not adversarial, process. The agency may be onlytoo happy to sign a consent decree that courts then rubber stamp. Often, state andindustry officials directly affected by the settlements have no opportunity to weigh in.Increasingly, sue and settle is how rules are made in Washington. The U.S. Chamberof Commerce has found that more than 60 times in the last four years the EPAagreed to settlements with environmental groups to pass regulations that in somecases impose tens of billions of dollars of costs on industry and land owners. The fedshave even paid green groups millions of dollars in legal fees for the favor of suing thegovernment.The Obama administration didn't invent sue and settle, but the pace hasincreased dramatically since 2009—an era that Oklahoma Attorney GeneralScott Pruitt calls "sue and settle on steroids."Last September Mr. Pruitt and 11 state attorneys general presented aFreedom of Information Act request to investigate the communications
Feb-17-2017 003601
between the Obama administration and environmental litigants. Their
suspicion is that the two are secretly working hand in hand to grease theprocess of regulating industries it doesn't like. A year has passed, but theEPA has refused to fully comply.This summer Mr. Pruitt has joined with the other attorneys general—including from Texas and Utah—to sue the Obama administration tocomply with the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Pruitt also believes thatsue and settle "is an end run around the Administrative Procedures Act."This is the law that governs how regulations are promulgated, and requiresamong other things transparency and a reliance on science to justify newrules. "An administration which claims to only want to 'follow the science'has exploited a litigation mechanism to enact new rules imposed on uswithout reviewing the science," Mr. Pruitt says.The attorneys general also cite new EPA regional haze rules—which cameinto being because of sue and settle—that could raise electricity costs intheir states by as much as 20%. On behalf of his fellow attorneys general,Mr. Pruitt says that "we're very worried that under Obama sue and settlewill be used by the EPA to issue new regulations on fracking." This couldkneecap the oil and gas boom in Western states.In its report "Sue and Settle: Regulating Behind Closed Doors," the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce has counted more than 100 new major rules "with estimated compliancecosts of more than $100 million annually" that arose from this tactic. The result is agiant tax on the economy brought to you by the Sierra Club and the EnvironmentalDefense Fund with little or no input or oversight from Congress.Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) and Rep. Doug Collins (R., Ga.) have introduced"Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2013" that would require allproposed consent decrees to be posted for 60 days for public comment before beingfiled with a court—and allow affected parties to challenge them. Members ofCongress in both parties who are worried about the Obama regulatory assault willneed to take corrective action if they have any hope of a true economic turnaround.Mr. Moore is a member of the Journal's editorial board.

Hi Clayton:
Per our conversation today, I am following up with a couple of items:
1.
As we discussed, below is Bill’s e-mail with attachments. Sorry, I gave Bill’s assistant a list of
recipients, and forgot to include you and Melissa (copied). 
2.
Also, our legal team took another review of the AG letter, and a good recommendation wasmade to include footnotes to source the quotes/legal arguments. The attached version is thesame one I originally sent to you, and which we just discussed, with the exception of theadded footnotes.
Thanks for putting the AG letter into action, and I think that this letter will make a strong statementand a real difference. Do you think that we will get any Democrats to sign the letter? Also, when youfinalize the document and send it out, can I please get a copy for my records?
Thanks again for your help, and let me know if you have any questions.

Just a note to provide you with Devon’s initial comments to the OMB Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs (OIRA) on the BLM’s newly proposed draft rule to place sweeping and unnecessaryfederal regulations on hydraulic fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands.
Feb-17-2017 003618
As you are preparing comments to be filed directly with the BLM by August 23, or are involved in other
matters surrounding the rule, we thought it would be helpful to share Devon’s current analysis andviews in the attached comments -- despite the fact that we fully expect to have an even morethorough understanding of the rule's costs, collection burdens, operational impacts and delays as wecontinue to analyze the new draft rule for our own August comments to BLM.
We believe it is important to note that the states — not the federal government — are best equipped todesign, administer and enforce laws and regulation related to oil and natural gas development. In fact,at the annual meeting of the Western Governors’ Association held in Park City, Utah, on June 28-30 apolicy resolution was adopted that stated (in part): “Western Governors recognize that the states,territories, and flag islands have effectively regulated the practice of hydraulic fracturing andredundant federal regulation is not required.”
In addition, the Federal Land Freedom Act (FLFA), which is also attached, was recently introduced inthe Senate. The Act demonstrates a strong commitment by a solid group of senators to adopt afederalism approach to energy development by empowering states to control all aspects of energydevelopment (leasing, permitting, regulation and enforcement) on federal lands within their borders.
States have an excellent record of protecting the environment and public health, while simultaneouslyfacilitating oil & natural gas development and promoting economic growth. Rather than force anunnecessary, one-size-fits-all regulatory regime on top of carefully crafted state-specific programs,BLM should instead work with states on how best to address any health, safety or environmental issuesarising from hydraulic fracturing and related operations on federal lands by deferring to proven stateregulatory and enforcement programs. By focusing too much on achieving “consistent” regulation (thatwe hear from DOI and BLM as being needed), rather than the 
best
 regulation, the BLM's proposalfundamentally ignores local and regional differences among states.
We hope that you find our filing useful. Also, please let us know if you have any questions or otherthoughts. And feel free to use and/or share Devon’s comments as you see fit.

Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)
Storm Outage Update #2:
 Wednesday, July 24, 2013 – 4:30 p.m.
PSO
is
dealing
with
significant
weather-related
power
outages
across
the
Tulsa
metropolitan
area
due
to
a
severe
thunderstorm
packing
60-80
mph
winds
that
struck
in
the
early
morning
hours.
 OUTAGES AND RESTORATION EFFORTSTulsa District
As
of
4:30
p.m.
Wednesday,
July
24,
PSO
had
restored
power
to
about
20,000
customers
who
lost
service
in
the
early
morning
storm,
leaving
approximately
76,300
customers
in
the
Tulsa
metro
area
without
electric
service. 
PSO
has
restored
service
to
16
main
feeder
power
lines,
with
76
still
out
of
operation.
Customer
outages
continue
to
be
most
numerous
in
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
metro
area.
At
present,
there
are
approximately
370
PSO
line
and
tree
workers
focused
on
restoring
power
in
the
Tulsa
metro
area. 
PSO
has
secured
an
additional
1,030
workers
from
other
AEP
companies
and
other
utilities
to
support
restoration
efforts.
Based
on
damage
assessment,
and
barring
any
future
weather
events,
PSO
estimates
it
could
take
until
5
p.m.,
Sunday,
July
28,
to
complete
power
restoration
to
95%
of
all
customers
who
can
take
service.
The
electric
service
to
many
customers
will
be
restored
much
sooner
than
that
time. 
This
initial
estimated
time
for
completing
power
restoration
will
be
updated
as
the
storm
recovery
work
progresses.
In
accordance
with
pre-arranged
plans,
PSO
will
use
a
portion
of
Expo
Square
for
parking
the
work
vehicles
of
out-of-town
crews,
for
refueling
vehicles,
and
for
staging
materials.
 CUSTOMER MESSAGES
Customers
should
prepare
for
a
multi-day
power
outage
and
are
urged
to
take
necessary
steps
to
ensure
their
health
and
safety
while
Feb-17-2017 003814
PSO works to restore power.
For
safety’s
sake,
assume
that
any
downed
utility
line
is
energized
with
deadly
electric
current. 
Stay
away
from
the
line
and
do
not
touch
it
with
anything. 
Report
it
to
PSO
at
1-888-216-3523.
 
Please
do
not
approach
crews
and
utility
vehicles
you
see
in
your
neighborhood
to
ask
when
power
will
be
restored. 
Doing
so
could
jeopardize
your
safety. 
Outward
vision
from
the
large
utility
vehicles
can
be
limited. 
A
crew
may
not
see
someone
who
has
walked
up
to
their
work
truck.
 INFORMATION
We
will
continue
to
provide
additional
information
to
you
as
the
restoration
effort
moves
forward.
A

 OKLAHOMA CITY – Despite an adverse circuit court ruling rebuffing the state of Oklahoma’s legalchallenge to an Environmental Protection Agency (APA) edict, a citizen activist group is continuing to fightthe controversial regional haze standard that could require Oklahoma power plants to switch fuels tooffset sulfur dioxide emissions. 
 Federal pressure on power generation in Oklahoma could have real-world implications, including aminimum 11-12 percent rate hike for residential consumers. While several state officials have opposedthe EPA maneuvers, some state officials have recently been quiet, and a key state utility firm has agreedto changes that will hike utility rates. 
 EPA critics have assailed underlying authority for the regulatory provision, which is based on a 1977amendment to the federal Clean Air Act. They decry it as “an aesthetic visibility standard” designed toreduce haze on government lands, with little gain for air quality. 
 Further, Americans for Prosperity-Oklahoma, says the projected double-digit rate hikes, if the EPA getsits way, will actually be closer to 20 percent – an average of $200 in increased costs for the typical statefamily. 
 Matt Ball, state director for AFP-OK, said, “At a time when Oklahomans overwhelmingly agree thatelectricity rates are already too high, why should state policymakers support a settlement agreement withthe Obama EPA and other liberal environmental groups like the Sierra Club that will raise rates on PSO[Public Service Company of Oklahoma] customers up to $200 more per year and pave the way for ratesto be raised on all Oklahomans?” 
 Ball continued, “President Obama has made clear his intentions on power plant regulation and this oneEPA regulation, by mandating fuel-switching, will effectively mandate how much Oklahomans will pay forelectricity.” 
 Last weekend, Ball told CapitolBeatOK the petition already had triggered 3,078 Oklahomans to contactstate officials via the petition letters. 
 Ball said, “While the heavy-handed approach of President Obama’s EPA is likely to result in utility ratehikes on Oklahoma families and businesses, what is more troubling is that state policymakers mightconsider supporting it. This plan hurts Oklahomans’ pocketbooks and makes our state less competitivefor jobs. AFP-OK is circulating this petition so that state policymakers are made aware of howOklahomans feel about this important pocketbook issue.” 
 In the first of a series of emails to AFP supporters and other free market advocates in the state, Ballassailed the EPA benchmark as operating “under the guise of pseudo-science.” 
 Commissioner of Labor Mark Costello told CapitolBeatOK, “Should this EPA mandated policy beimplemented in our state, I have serious concerns about the negative impact on Oklahoma's wageearners.” He asserted, “There is no urgent need for the state of Oklahoma to rush into embracing a policybased solely on EPA demands. This issue needs to be fully 'vetted' by the Oklahoma Corporation
Feb-17-2017 003911
Commission.” 
 That three-member commission is the constitutional state agency that regulates many businesses,including all utility companies. 
Costello and other critics 
of the haze mandate say 
it could erode two of Oklahoma’s key economic
advantages
 – comparatively robust employment (a 5 percent jobless rate, among the nation’s lowest) andlow cost of doing business, not to mention wage improvements over several years 
 The Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers (OIEC) and the state Energy Coalition have faced off withstate members of 
the Sierra Club, who back the haze rule
. 
 Frustrating advocates of energy independence, the EPA applied the regional haze standard to theWichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge near Lawton, in southwestern Oklahoma. EPA has pressuredfor fuel switching (from “clean coal” to natural gas) at power plants more than 250 miles away, in the farnortheast corner of the Sooner State. 
 The situation has provoked unusual division among utility firms. While Public Service Company ofOklahoma (PSO) is willing to settle with EPA, the Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) has fought theissue in court. 
 Last Friday (July 26), 
a divided Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel rejected Oklahoma’s April 2012
petition
 to rebuff the EPA’s haze rule, 
issued in December 2011. 
 Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt assailed the Tenth Circuit decision, saying, “We disagree and aredisappointed with the panel’s 2-1 decision. We will continue to fight to preserve the ability of Oklahomastakeholders to create an Oklahoma solution and to protect Oklahoma consumers from excessive andunnecessary utility costs. We are reviewing the decision and considering our options.” 
 U.S. Rep. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma City, said he was “frustrated” with the circuit court ruling, whichhe characterizes as “needless and excessive.” Unless the ruling is tempered upon further review, “It isnow certain that Oklahoma utility customers will face a new rate hike without any health or economicbenefit.” 
 In addition to fighting the circuit ruling, Pruitt is part of a coalition of state attorneys general seeking tounderstand the EPA’s alleged “sue and settle” strategy. A federal lawsuit against EPA, filed inOklahoma’s western district, seeks disclosure of EPA tactics benefiting environmental groups likeGreenpeace, Defenders of Wildlife, Wildearth Guardians and the Sierra Club. 
 Pruitt characterizes “sue-and-settle” and the regional haze controversy as part of a “blatant strategy bythe EPA to go around the process and bend the rules to create environmental regulations that have failedin Congress.” In a total of 45 settlements already made public, EPA has paid out nearly $1 million inattorneys’ fees to environmental groups, Pruitt and the other state AGs assert. 
 Earlier this year, the states of Oklahoma, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, NorthDakota, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyoming submitted to EPA a federal open records requestfocused on the “sue-and-settle” strategy.

to
an

the

haze
standard
that
could

Oklahoma
power

to
switch

to
offset
sulfur

emissions.
Federal

in

could
have
real-world
implications,
including
a
minimum
11-12
percent
rate

for
residential
consumers.
While

the

some

have

quiet,
and
a
key
state
utility

has
agreed

that

EPA
critics
have
assailed
underlying
authority
for
the
regulatory
provision,
which
is
based
on
a
1977
amendment
to
the
federal
Clean
Air
Act.
They
decry
it
as
“an
aesthetic
visibility
standard”
designed
to
reduce
haze
on
government
lands,
with
little
gain
for
air
quality.
Further,
Americans
for
Prosperity-Oklahoma,
says
the
projected
double-digit
rate
hikes,
if
the
EPA
gets
its
way,
will
actually
be
closer
to
20
percent
–
an
average
of
$200
in
increased
costs
for
the
typical
state
family. 
Matt
Ball,
state
director
for
AFP-OK,
said,
“At
a
time
when
Oklahomans
overwhelmingly
agree
that
electricity
rates
are
already
too
high,
why
should
state
policymakers
support
a
settlement
agreement
with
the
Obama
EPA
and
other
liberal
environmental
groups
like
the
Sierra
Club
that
will
raise
rates
on
PSO
[Public
Service
Company
of
Oklahoma]
customers
up
to
$200
more
per
year
and
pave
the
way
for
rates
to
be
raised
on
all
Oklahomans?”
Ball
continued,
“President
Obama
has
made
clear
his
intentions
on
power
plant
regulation
and
this
one
EPA
regulation,
by
mandating
fuel-switching,
will
effectively
mandate
how
much
Oklahomans
will
pay
for
electricity.”
Last weekend, Ball told CapitolBeatOK the petition already had triggered 3,078 Oklahomans to
Feb-17-2017 003916
contact state officials via the petition letters.
Ball
said,
“While
the
heavy-handed
approach
of
President
Obama’s
EPA
is
likely
to
result
in
utility
rate
hikes
on
Oklahoma
families
and
businesses,
what
is
more
troubling
is
that
state
policymakers
might
consider
supporting
it.
This
plan
hurts
Oklahomans’
pocketbooks
and
makes
our
state
less
competitive
for
jobs.
AFP-OK
is
circulating
this
petition
so
that
state
policymakers
are
made
aware
of
how
Oklahomans
feel
about
this
important
pocketbook
issue.”
In
the
first
of
a
series
of
emails
to
AFP
supporters
and
other
free
market
advocates
in
the
state,
Ball
assailed
the
EPA
benchmark
as
operating
“under
the
guise
of
pseudo-science.” 
Commissioner
of
Labor
Mark
Costello
told
CapitolBeatOK,
“Should
this
EPA
mandated
policy
be
implemented
in
our
state,
I
have
serious
concerns
about
the
negative
impact
on
Oklahoma's
wage
earners.”
He
asserted,
“There
is
no
urgent
need
for
the
state
of
Oklahoma
to
rush
into
embracing
a
policy
based
solely
on
EPA
demands.
This
issue
needs
to
be
fully
'vetted'
by
the
Oklahoma
Corporation
Commission.” 
That
three-member
commission
is
the
constitutional
state
agency
that
regulates
many
businesses,
including
all
utility
companies. 
Costello
and
other
critics 
of
the
haze
mandate
say 
it
could
erode
two
of
Oklahoma’s
key
economic
advantages
 –
comparatively
robust
employment
(a
5
percent
jobless
rate,
among
the
nation’s
lowest)
and
low
cost
of
doing
business,
not
to
mention
wage
improvements
over
several
years
The
Oklahoma
Industrial
Energy
Consumers
(OIEC)
and
the
state
Energy
Coalition
have
faced
off
with
state
members
of 
the
Sierra
Club,
who
back
the
haze
rule
. 
Frustrating
advocates
of
energy
independence,
the
EPA
applied
the
regional
haze
standard
to
the
Wichita
Mountains
National
Wildlife
Refuge
near
Lawton,
in
southwestern
Oklahoma.
EPA
has
pressured
for
fuel
switching
(from
“clean
coal”
to
natural
gas)
at
power
plants
more
than
250
miles
away,
in
the
far
northeast
corner
of
the
Sooner
State.
The
situation
has
provoked
unusual
division
among
utility
firms.
While
Public
Service
Company
of
Oklahoma
(PSO)
is
willing
to
settle
with
EPA,
the
Oklahoma
Gas
and
Electric
(OG&E)
has
fought
the
issue
in
court.
Last
Friday
(July
26), 
a
divided
Tenth
U.S.
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
panel
rejected
Oklahoma’s
April
2012
petition
 to
rebuff
the
EPA’s
haze
rule,
 issued
in
December
2011. 
Oklahoma
Attorney
General
Scott
Pruitt
assailed
the
Tenth
Circuit
decision,
saying,
“We
disagree
and
are
disappointed
with
the
panel’s
2-1
decision.
We
will
continue
to
fight
to
preserve
the
ability
of
Oklahoma
stakeholders
to
create
an
Oklahoma
solution
and
to
protect
Oklahoma
consumers
from
excessive
and
unnecessary
utility
costs.
We
are
reviewing
the
decision
and
considering
our
options.”
U.S.
Rep.
James
Lankford,
R-Oklahoma
City,
said
he
was
“frustrated”
with
the
circuit
court
ruling,
which
he
characterizes
as
“needless
and
excessive.”
Unless
the
ruling
is
tempered
upon
further
review, “It is now certain that Oklahoma utility customers will face a new rate hike without any
Feb-17-2017 003917
health or economic benefit.”
In
addition
to
fighting
the
circuit
ruling,
Pruitt
is
part
of
a
coalition
of
state
attorneys
general
seeking
to
understand
the
EPA’s
alleged
“sue
and
settle”
strategy.
A
federal
lawsuit
against
EPA,
filed
in
Oklahoma’s
western
district,
seeks
disclosure
of
EPA
tactics
benefiting
environmental
groups
like
Greenpeace,
Defenders
of
Wildlife,
Wildearth
Guardians
and
the
Sierra
Club. 
Pruitt
characterizes
“sue-and-settle”
and
the
regional
haze
controversy
as
part
of
a
“blatant
strategy
by
the
EPA
to
go
around
the
process
and
bend
the
rules
to
create
environmental
regulations
that
have
failed
in
Congress.”
In
a
total
of
45
settlements
already
made
public,
EPA
has
paid
out
nearly
$1
million
in
attorneys’
fees
to
environmental
groups,
Pruitt
and
the
other
state
AGs
assert. 
Earlier
this
year,
the
states
of
Oklahoma,
Alabama,
Arizona,
Georgia,
Kansas,
Michigan,
Nebraska,
North
Dakota,
South
Carolina,
Texas,
Utah
and
Wyoming
submitted
to
EPA
a
federal
open
records
request
focused
on
the
“sue-and-settle”
strategy.
