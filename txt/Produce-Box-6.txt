Description:

Happy Upcoming Easter!,
The Doctor has another test bar coming up. I think we’ll have enough
people for a test bar on Easter, so let’s do drinks on Sunday, April 20th. We’ll
start at 3PM, so don’t miss the first drinks! I bumper it back an hour, so we
can do our morning Easter thing with family with enough time to regroup
before the test bar starts. Significant others are welcome. Let me know if
you’ll be there and if you need help with directions. We kind of did the
carrot drink thing last test bar, but I have some other initial thoughts on the
drink menu:
-

-

Drinkin’ With My Peeps, I dunno what it is, but it’s gonna have Peeps in it.
The Roserunner, a watermelon juice cocktail.
The Beet Down you guessed it: beet juice.
Tim D’s Wabbit in a Wheelchair.
A Danish Mary, an Akvavit Bloody Mary.
Lindsay’s Lament, with Becherovka. (I found some!)
Something with Cadbury Eggs We’ll figure it out, Brett...
The Cucumber Cooler.

And more! Anything you’ve been dying to try? Let me know and we’ll give it
a shot on Sunday! Don’t forget, guest bartenders are welcome, if anyone
wants to get behind the stick and concoct something for the group. Thanks
to everyone who chipped in food, booze, or money last time not necessary,
but feel free to do it again! If you bring booze or a challenge ingredient, I will
certainly do my best to incorporate it into a drink for the group.

Subject: Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma’s Leadership Council

Beth and Christy,
I hope that you lovely ladies are having a great Thursday! I need to ask a small favor. Would you be
willing to send out a request for applicants for the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma’s new Leadership
Council to the LOYAL alums?
The Leadership Council connects young professionals interested in getting involved in their community
and state through engagement with the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. These dedicated individuals,
aged 24 to 35, volunteer their time and creativity to raise awareness about the issue of hunger and
increase the visibility of the Regional Food Bank and its mission of “Fighting Hunger.. .Feeding Hope” in
Oklahoma.
Leadership Council members receive special access to volunteer opportunities, networking events and
social events, as well as educational and informational programs designed to appeal to Oklahoma’s
active young professionals in the community.
If you don’t mind sending this opportunity out to the LOYAL alums you could include the following
hyperlinks that will give them mote information about this program.
Click here for more information on the Leadership Council. For more information about the Regional
Food Bank, watch a short video about the Food Bank, watch a video about Food for Kids, or review
information about hunger in Oklahoma and the nonprofit.
To join the Leadership Council they will need to complete this form and send it to Angie Gaines at
aqaines(reqionalfooUbank.org no later than May 15, 2014. They will need to include a letter of reference
and a copy of their resume.
I would greatly appreciate your assistance to send out an email, but I certainly understand if this is not an
appropriate request. Please let me know if you have any questions about this opportunity.
Sincerely,

Description:

Howdy!
My apologies for the late notice, but the second Sunday snuck up on me this
month! Hopefully we’ll be able to get a good group together this weekend
after everybody does their Mother’s Day thing; we’ll try to do drinks on
Sunday, May 11th. We’ll start at the normal time, 2PM, so don’t miss the
first drinks! Significant others are welcome. Let me know if you’ll be there
and if you need help with directions. We’ll do some summer drinks, maybe
something for the Kentucky Derby, and something Cinco de Mayo-ish:
-

-

-

-

-

-

-

A Mint Julep, or some variation
Fair to Partly Cloudy, w/Strong Tonic, if I can figure it out
Some kind of Shandy
A Mojito variation
Ginger Beer Margarita
Strawberry Bourbon Smash
Cardamom/Pear Champagne Cocktail

-

The Yosemite Sam w/ Pepper Jelly

And more! Anything you’ve been dying to try? Let me know and we’ll give it
a shot on Sunday! Don’t forget, guest bartenders are welcome, if anyone
wants to get behind the stick and concoct something for the group. Thanks
to everyone who chipped in food, booze, or money last time not necessary,
but feel free to do it again! If you bring booze or a challenge ingredient, I will
certainly do my best to incorporate it into a drink for the group.

Thursday’s Meeting

<turnerwaddell@yahoo.com>, Will Harlow <Willionaire2998@gmail.com>
We had a very productive meeting this afternoon. Some of the thing that were covered are
described below:
• Please update your contact information here if you have any changes.
• The students were given a BSN flyer (see attached).
o THIS IS THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO ORDER.
o All orders need to be in before May 25.
o If any students have duplicate jersey numbers, I will be contacting you individually.
o All of the items will be shipped to the school, and I will distribute them.
o If you have any questions about the online BSN store, you can ask me or Tyler
Gaines at tgaines@bsnsports.com.
• We discussed Powercamp, open gym opportunities (TEA in a latter email), and possible
summer team camp options for the varsity.
o In order for me to best determine dates for this summer, I need to know the
student’s availability. Please fill out this Summer Availability Questionnaire.
• Our current game schedule can be found here. Also, preseason practices will begin on
Monday, August 4th.
I am looking forward to a terrific summer and season ahead!

I wanted to remind everyone that there are only 5 days left to order from the BSN shop...
The first three items on the flyer are mandatory for all players. iv will wear these for their
uniform and the varsity will wear them for scrimmages and practice.
Also, if you are on financial aid, you can speak with the business office about purchasing
through the school.
Thanks and please let me know if you have any questions!

House Democrats Announce 2013 Legislative Agenda
OKLAHOMA CITY- House Democrats outlined today their priorities and positions for the 2013
legislative session.
“The issues in front of the Oklahoma legislature this year will define not only our progress as a state in
the coming year, but also in the years to come,” said Democratic Leader Scott Inman, D-Del City.

“Our legislative agenda reveals our priorities as a caucus as well as the differences between Democratic
and Republican values,” said Leader Inman. “As Democrats, we believe that we must create policies
that increase the standard of living in Oklahoma for all of our state’s citizens, not just the most affluent
sectors. We also believe we must do justice to the hardships and challenges many Oklahomans face
through proactive policy. We believe we have done so by carefully crafling a legislative agenda that will
accomplish our goals.”
Legislative priorities for the House Democratic Caucus include the budget, health care, public safety and
transportation, education, and worker’s compensation reform. House Democrats believe their vision for
the 54th legislative session will fortify Oklahoma and capitalize upon the strengths of its people and
resources, in contrast to the Republicans’ policies that will enrich the few at the cost of the many.
Tue Budget: Reinvesting in Oklahoma
Disrepair recently prompted Gov. Mary Fallin to again ask that legislators create a funding plan to fix the
sewage, plumbing, and electrical problems in the state capitol building.

POR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

House Democrats Announce 2013 Leg...

“We’ve known about this problem for a very long time,” Faiim said in a January 18th article in the
Oklahoman. “We’ve got to get some guts and deal with the issue and take care of it.”
House Democrats, however, disagree that “guts” have anything to do with the governor’s refusal to use
growing revenues to restore funding to a broad spectrum of core state programs and agencies that have
seen up to 20 percent in cuts over the past five years while asking to increase the state’s indebtedness by
issuing bonds in order to pay for the capitol building’s repair.
“Oklahomans deserve a responsible budget that doesn’t increase our debt,” said Rep. Mike Brown,
D-Tahlequah, Democratic Ranking Member on the Appropriations and Budget Committee. “Whereas
the Republican agenda has been to shrink government by starving it through the legislative process and
gutting funding to, for instance, public broadcasting and senior nutrition and veterans’ centers,
Democrats propose a reasonable budget that restores funding to core public services and a tax policy
that is fair and equitable for all Oklahomans.”
The House Democrats recommend a pay-as-you-go approach to the budget that reinstates dollars for
under-funded and crucial state services, protects our revenue stream, and, learning from Kansas’
experience, sees no promise for increased, widespread prosperity after a reduced or eliminated state
income tax.
“Our Caucus will also continue to oppose any cuts to the state income tax,” said Leader Inman. “The
House Democratic Caucus believes that a strong and vibrant Oklahoma can only grow its economy if we
support a sound, fiscally responsible budget that doesn’t slash revenues while pushing the state further
into debt.”
Health Care: Investing in Oklahoma ‘c Health (‘are Needs
A strong and vibrant Oklahoma relies upon not only a fiscally responsible budget, but also a healthy
citizenry. With Governor Fallin refusing to expand Medicaid, the House Democrats reiterate their
position that investing in our state’s health care system is also a prudent investment in its long-term
economic future.
“A healthy state and a healthy economy go hand in hand,” said Leader Inman. “The expansion of
Medicaid would bring us closer to this reality for the thousands of Oklahomans who are currently unable
to afford and access health insurance. But with nearly $600 million in uncompensated care being
delivered every year, our doctors and hospitals at the front lines of our health care system, especially in
rural areas, are struggling to survive.”
The House Democrats believe that at the state level, our government should assist in providing medical
care for our most vulnerable communities, including veterans, seniors, children, and others who cannot
meet their basic needs without help. The Democratic Caucus also supports Gov. Fallin’s call to increase
funding for mental health care in Oklahoma.
“An unhealthy state and a health care system incapable of meeting the needs of its residents,” said
Leader Inman, “does not cultivate an environment suitable for attracting businesses. As Democrats, we
believe that we can maintain a climate conducive to attracting businesses to Oklahoma while protecting
our citizens with the health care mandates so many Republicans oppose.”
“I am looking forward to the debate on how Oklahoma citizens without access to affordable health care

can benefit from new health insurance exchanges,” said Rep. Jeannie McDaniel, D-Tulsa, and
Democratic Ranking Member on the Public Health Committee. “This will be a challenge for legislators
as we work to comply with federal law while keeping an eye on improving the lives of those amongst us
who can be healthy productive individuals with an affordable safety net of care.”
Transportation and Public Safety: Investing in Infrastructure and Security
Oklahoma’s long-term economic health and its ability to attract and maintain business also depend upon
a sound infrastructure and a secure populace. Deep budget cuts to transportation and public safety in
recent years, however, have adversely affected the State of Oklahoma’s obligation to provide safe roads,
bridges, and public spaces for all of our residents.
House Democrats call to fund the state’s investment in the Department of Transportation’s 8-year
program to fix Oklahoma’s roads and crumbling infrastructure, reversing the $100 million raid by the
governor and the Republicans on DOT’s budget in 2011.
House Democrats support increased funding for agencies tasked with protecting the public, in order to
remedy what Rep. Jeff Hickman, R-Dacoma, called a “life or death situation” regarding staffing and
funding levels for the Departments of Public Safety and Corrections.
“Because of draconian budget cuts over the past four years, the Department of Public Safety and the
Department of Corrections are sorely under-funded and under-staffed,” said Leader Inman. “With
increased funding, we can increase our Corrections officers’ salaries, as well as the number of
corrections officers, state troopers and law enforcement officers, and full-time employees at OSBI and
the medical examiner’s office.”
After the recent school shootings in Newtown, Conn., a prominent theme in bills filed by the legislature
this year center on school safety. House Democrats adamantly support secure schools for all Oklahoma
students but caution against knee-jerk laws that fail to take the budget into consideration and overburden
education and public safety agencies with more unfunded mandates and liabilities.
“The bottom line is, how much is the state willing to pay for school security?” asked Rep. Brian
Renegar, D- McAlester, and Democratic Ranking Member on the Public Safety Conmiittee. “How much
is our leadership willing to spend on safety for our children? Education and public safety have both been
under-funded for the past four to five years, even though these are both core functions of government.
Now our leaders must decide how they will adequately fund both these areas in order to protect students
and the general public.”
Education: Investing in Oklahoma’s Students
Recent events have indeed renewed our concerns regarding our children’s security in school. Parents
and care takers must feel confident that their children are not only physically secure at school every day,
but that the most precious members of our society are receiving a sound education.
House Democrats believe that a community that truly values human life will arm all its members with the
intellectual and emotional tools of a rigorous education necessary to navigate modern life.
Our Caucus believes that the key to a sound education for our children include the availability of brick
and-mortar schools unburdened by unfunded legislative mandates or administrators lacking educational

expertise.
House Democrats also believe in reinstating many of the programs and incentives which have seen
drastic cuts by Republicans in recent years, including National Board Certification bonuses.

“Our schools and educators are undergoing a series of transitions that are the result of legislation based
on the assumption that our public schools are failing,” said Rep. Ed Cannaday, D-Porum, Democratic
Ranking Member on the Common Education Committee. “I wish we would put our legislators and other
elected officials under the same scrutiny as our educators and schools.”
House Democrats support the State Board of Education’s request for $300 million additional funds for
Oklahoma schools, including $37 million to be allotted this school year.
“A primary way to attract businesses to our state is through a strong and successful public school system
that prepares our students for the jobs companies are looking to fill in the future,” said Leader Inman.
“Our Caucus believes that we should reinvest in our schools to prevent further teacher layoffs,
increasing class sizes, and the elimination of important programs like art, band, and advanced placement.
We believe these are investments in our children and our future that will pay dividends, many times
over.”

Dear Panelists,
We’re looking forward to your panel on Monday at 3:40. As you can see from the attached agenda, we have
allocated almost 2 hours for your presentations.
For purposes of our discussion, please assume that there is a war on carbon and that there are some benefits
to the reduction in carbon emissions. What is often missing from the policy discussion is the costs.
I will moderate your panel. We will have a brief panel discussion after each presentation. I suggest the
following order and timing:
General Pruitt will open with a broad discussion of the impact of current policies on federalism, jobs, the rule
of law, etc. (20 to 25 minutes for presentation)
—

Roger Nober will address some of the special challenges that BNSF and the industries its serves are facing (15
minutes for presentation)
—

Shawn Regan will discuss his research on the adverse consequences of current policies for Native Americans
(15 minutes for presentation)
—

Nathan Richardson will share his views on the benefits of current policies and the relevance (or irrelevance)
of the previous presentations. (15 minutes for presentation)
—

Frank Wolak will compare and contrast the views presented from the economic perspective he will have
offered in the keynote opening lecture.
—

Time permitting, all of this will be followed by a moderated Q&A with the audience.
I’m looking forward to a dynamic and interactive panel.
If possible, please submit your PowerPoints (not required) by Friday at noon.
Please contact Jeff Smith at 703-993-8382 with any questions.
Thank you.

In Case You Missed It

EOK
Tom Coburn, Scott Pruitt: Working to educate
on the significance of the Constitution
BY TOM COBURN AND SCOH PRUITI • Published: September 20, 2014
The Constitution has been the guide and vision for this nation since it was signed on Sept. 17, 1787.
Today, 227 years later, fewer people than ever understand basic American civics: our government, how it
works and how it was created.
The result is fewer people participating in and determining the outcome of elections. The percentage of
people who regularly vote is at an all-time low; dissatisfaction with the institutions of government has
never been higher.
To solve the problems this country faces, we need educated, informed voters who understand
government and who know how to make their voices heard. That’s why we support the Oklahoma Civics
Education Initiative.
The initiative would require Oklahoma high school students and those pursuing a GED to pass a test
made up of 100 basic facts about U.S. government, geography and history from the U.S. Citizenship
Civics Test
the exact same test all new immigrants must pass before becoming citizens.
While 91 percent of new immigrants pass this test, many of them while still learning English, a survey by
the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs showed that barely 5 percent of high school seniors can do the
same. Moreover, only 32 percent of Americans can correctly name the Constitution as the supreme law
of the land, according to the Xavier Center for the Study of the American Dream.
We can do better for this generation of students. This initiative is a concrete first step to ensuring that
Oklahoma high school students graduate with the fundamental knowledge to become engaged citizens.
Those who are educated about government, by and large, participate at a higher rate.
—

George Washington, the first U.S. president and president of the constitutional convention, said, “A

primary object should be the education of our youth in the science of government. In a republic, what
species of knowledge can be equally important?”
In addition to efforts here in Oklahoma, community and business leaders in six other states are launching
campaigns this year to pass the Civics Education Initiative. The goal is to pass Civics Education
Initiative legislation in all 50 states, one state at a time, by Sept. 17, 2017. That’s the 230th anniversary
of the Constitution.
We can’t think of a better way to celebrate this anniversary than to ensure that every future high school
graduate knows its significance.
Coburn, R-Muskogee, is finishing his fmal year in the U.S. Senate. Pruitt, also a Republican, is
Oklahoma’s attorney general. For information on the initiative, go to
www.CivicsEducationInitiative.com.

MEDIA ADVISORY
Immediate release: December 2, 2014
State Sen. Anastasia Pittman has scheduled a news conference for 10 a.m. Wednesday, Dec. 3, to formally ask the
Oklahoma Secondary School Activity Association (OSSAA) to allow for a replay of all or part of the Class 3A football
quarterfinal playoff game last week between Oklahoma City’s Frederick A. Douglass High School and Locust Grove High
School.
Pittman, D-Oklahoma City, will be joined by Douglass coach Willis Alexander at the news conference along with
community and religious leaders and representatives from the NAACP. Pittman also invites elected officials and other
interested parties to attend.
The news conference will be held in Room 432-3 of the Oklahoma State Capitol.
The Douglass Trojans scored a touchdown to take a 25-20 lead with a minute to play in Friday’s playoff game, but the
touchdown was disallowed because of an improperly enforced penalty. Proper procedure called for the touchdown to
stand and the penalty to be enforced after the score, but the touchdown was improperly taken away. Locust Grove went on

to win the game 20-19 and advance to the state semifinals.
Oklahoma leaders like Sen. David Holt and former University of Oklahoma football coach Barry Switzer have called for
the OSSAA to allow the final minute of the game to be replayed. Oklahoma City Public Schools officially requested a
replay, but the OSSAA denied it. The OSSAA Board of Directors is set to hear an appeal of the decision Wednesday.
“This is an opportunity for the OSSAA to do the right thing,” Pittman said. “This is about an organization of adults that
has taken something away from a group of Oklahoma children, and the ability to decide to make things right and let this
playoff game be settled on the field.”
For more information, contact: Sen. Anastasia Pittman, (405) 521-5531

CYBER EXTORTION RISKS
• Denial of access to files

—

Crypto-Locker, Crypto-Wall

o

Staged by extortionists based in Former Soviet Union

o

Numerous companies paid modest ransoms to regain access to
files

• Hacking to obtain information that would embarrass a company
o

Remember that sensitive information can also leave the company
in other ways: electronic eavesdropping or inside source

Managing Cyber Extortion Threats
•

Notify the FBI Immediately of the extortion attempt.
(Note: Cyber crime has recently been given higher priority than
counterterrorism.)

•

Preserve copies of all digital communications for investigators.

•

Working With law enforcement, attempt to establish a dialogue with the extortionist, May not
be possible.

•

Decid, whether It is appropriate to pay the ransom.

•

Law-enforcement may accede to a payment. Exceptions would be persona and entitles on the
OFAC list and the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act list.

•

When going for an arrest, try to smoke out extortionist by making down payment.
Extoilioniat may be disgruntled ex-employee.

•

Cyber-attacks come from both the US and overseas. There are black holes overseas—
countries that may not be receptive to cooperating with FBI: Russia, Balarus, Iran, North
Korea are not cooperative. Ukraine Romania are cooperating.

•

Payment methods could be simple or esoteric
card, bank accountlATM withdrawal Sitcom.

Well, it’s that special time, again. It seems like it’s been a while, but I just
realized that this Sunday is the second Sunday of the month. We’ll start at
the normal time, 2PM, so don’t miss the first drinks! Significant others are
welcome. Let me know if you’ll be there and if you need help with
directions. We’ll do some more summer drinks:
The Southside
The Zombie
The Smoking Jacket
The Lipsin
The Apartment-Cleaning Cardamom Cocktail (Apparently, the process of
toasting cardamom and making the syrup with the pears makes your place
smell awesome, no matter what shape it was in before.)
The Painkiller
The Paloma

And more! Anything you’ve been dying to try? Let me know and we’ll give
it a shot on Sunday! Don’t forget, guest bartenders are welcome, if anyone

to everyone who chipped in food, booze, or money last time not necessary,
but feel free to do it again! If you bring booze or a challenge ingredient, I will
certainly do my best to incorporate it into a drink for the group.

ORDER GRANTiNG APPLICATION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
The Corporation Commission of the State of Oklahoma (“the Commission”) being
regularly in session and the undersigned Commissioners being present and participating, there
comes on for consideration the Application for a Protective Order, filed by Oklahoma Gas and
Electric Company (“OG&E” or “Company”).
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The Commission fmds that it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article DC, Section 18 of the
Oklahoma Constitution, Title 51 O.S. §24A.22 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
The Commission further fmds that the Oklahoma Open Records Act, 51 OS. §24A.1, et
seq., states the purpose of the act is to ensure and facilitate the public’s right of access to and
review of government records so the public may efficiently and intelligently exercise their
inherent political power.
The Commission further finds that the Oklahoma Legislature has allowed the
Commission a specific exemption to the Oklahoma Open Records Act, allowing limited
information to be kept confidential:
The Corporation Commission shall keep confidential those records
of a public utility, its affiliates, suppliers and customers which the
Commission determines are confidential books and records or
trade secrets. 51 OKLA. STAT. § 24A.22(A)

Feb-17-2017 008023

Cause No. PUD 201400137— Protective Order

The Commission further finds that the Commission has given consideration to the
specific request set forth in the Application for a Protective Order brought forth in this Cause
which is addressed in this Order.
The Commission further fmds that a Protective Order should be issued in this Cause
because the integrated resource plan OG&E is required to file by OAC 165:35-37-4 may contain
confidential information which the Commission hereby determines to be confidential books,
records or trade secrets of the public utility, its affiliates, suppliers and/or customers.
Information required or allowed by law to be confidential shall also be considered confidential
by the Commission. Information already in the public domain shall not be considered
confidential by the Commission.
The Commission further fmds that the Commission desires access to information and
records claimed as confidential in nature in order for the Commission and the Commission’s
Public Utility Division (“PUD”) to sufficiently review OG&E’s integrated resource plan.
The Commission further fmds that the claimed confidential information shall be used by
the Commission solely in connection with its review of the integrated resource plan and that the
confidential material will not be introduced or used as testimony or exhibits in any public
meeting or cause, except on an in camera basis unless said information is presented in a
summary format such that confidential material cannot be determined therefrom; provided,
however, that the Commission may in a subsequent Cause request the same information,
permitting the submitting party to request that said information be received under protective
order in that cause.
The Commission further finds that the parties, except PUD, shall use the Confidentiality
Agreement (ccAgreement) attached as Attachment “A” to protect confidential information.
The Commission further finds that a requesting party shall request relief from this
Protective Order from the Commission before any of the confidential material is revealed to any
third party including, but not limited to, participants in any integrated resource plan reviews,
stakeholder conferences or public meetings convened to discuss the integrated resource plan. Mi
confidential information shall be clearly designated/identified on the face of the document(s) and
shall be limited to the following:
The contemplated IRP contains trade secrets and information from OG&E’s
and OG&E’s affiliates, contractors’ and suppliers’ confidential books and
records including, but not limited to, fuel price forecasts, marginal costs and
any non-public data, facts or other information sought in any form of
discovery including, but not limited to, data requests, interrogatones, request
for information, demands for admissions or depositions, or non-public facts
or information which OG&E has determined could be used by a competitor,
potential competitor or any other person or entity to the detriment of OG&E
or its affiliates, contractors, suppliers or customers. The specific areas
needing protection are related to the following:

Cause No. PUD 201400137— Protective Order

1.

fuel supply, fuel transportation and fuel storage agreements and other
related information, cost estimates, commodity price forecasts and load
forecasts.

2.

any non-public data, facts or other information regarding or related
to the current, past or future configuration, operation, performance,
maintenance or capital expenditures for any OG&E facility.

3.

any non-public data, facts or other information regarding or related
to the current, past or future business operations of OG&E and any
internally developed market price forecast for fuel or energy.

4.

any third party confidential information, including supplier or
contractor price information.

5.

any trade secrets utilized by OG&E including, but not limited to, its
strategic process for acquisition of generation assets to be used to
fulfill its public service obligation, and all information designated as
privileged or confidential by non-affiliate counterparties. Any request
for such disclosure shall be provided by OG&E immediately to the
non-affiliate counterparty in question, and such non-affiliate
counterparty shall have an opportunity to protest the disclosure prior
to the release of any portion of such information to the requesting
party.

6.

any non-public data, facts or other information regarding the
acquisition of fuel supply, fuel transportation, fuel storage, and
electricity (power purchases) including, but not limited to, invoices
and correspondence.

The Commission further finds that individuals who may receive confidential information
be restricted to Commission or Attorney General employees and outside counsel and outside
consultants who are not or do not represent entities involved in selling, purchasing or trading
power and who agree not to disclose the confidential information.
The Commission further finds that the issuance of this Protective Order is not a waiver of
any right of the parties to challenge any claim that the requested material is privileged or
confidential, and that any challenge made to the protected status provided the confidential and/or
privileged material, under 51 O.S. §24A.22 and this Order, may be made in open court in
accordance with the Commission’s Rules of Practice, provided that any discussion, disclosure or
use of the substantive content of the protected material shall be done in camera before an
Administrative Law Judge (“AU”) or the Commission en bane, with each party having three (3)
business days to respond to any challenge to the claimed confidential material and the
opportunity to be heard by the AU or the Commission en banc, as appropriate. The public
utility shall bear the burden of proving its entitlement to confidential treatment of any claimed
confidential material.

The Commission further finds that all claimed confidential information, as set forth
above, shall remain protected from public disclosure until otherwise ordered by the Commission.
ORDER
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the requested Protective Order is hereby granted
pursuant to the findings and directives set forth herein.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Confidentiality Agreement attached hereto as
Attachment “A” is approved and shall be used by the parties, except PUD and any other
Commission employees required to participate in this Cause, as needed to protect confidential
information produced in this cause. Nothing in this protective order shall be deemed to prevent
the disclosure of any information, which must be maintained as a “public record” or for “public
use” pursuant to State statute or the Oklahoma Constitution.
THIS ORDER SHALL BE EFFECTIVE immediately.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
WHEREAS, the parties herein have agreed that the procedures shall be established and
followed for the protection of information and documents produced, given, exchanged or
otherwise used by and among the parties in the course of discovery and other proceedings in this
cause.
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
1.
Any document or any information produced or required to be produced by the
parties or exchanged by the parties in the course of discovery in this Cause, which satisfies the
conditions set forth below, may be designated by the producing party as “confidential” or “highly
sensitive confidential.” Documents and information shall only be designated as “confidential” or
“highly sensitive confidential” upon the good faith determination by the producing party,
concurred in by counsel representing that party, that such documents or information are
confidential as delineated in the Protective Order issued in this Cause. The standard regarding
the definition of “confidential” in any classification dispute shall be the common or other
applicable law of the State of Oklahoma. “Highly sensitive confidential” documents and
information are a subset composed of information which a responding party claims is of such a
highly sensitive nature that the making of copies of such information by or for the requesting
party having access to such information as contemplated in Paragraph 7 of this Confidentiality
Agreement (“Agreement”) would expose the producing party to an unreasonable risk of harm.
2.
“Confidential” information and “highly sensitive confidential” information shall
not include information found by the Administrative Law Judge (“AU”), the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission (“Commission”), or a court of competent jurisdiction not to merit the
protection afforded “confidential” information or “highly sensitive confidential” information
under the terms of this Agreement.
3.
As to documents and information produced to another party, only such documents
or information as have been determined to be “confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential”
under the terms of this Agreement and which are clearly marked and identified as such under the
terms of this Agreement shall be deemed “confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential”
information and entitled to receive the protection afforded by this Agreement. The designation
5

Cause No. PUD 201400137— Protective Order
of “confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential” documents and information shall be made
initially by the producing party prior to, or contemporaneously with, the production of such
documents or information to the other party in accordance with this Agreement.
4.
“Confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential” documents and information shall
not be disclosed by counsel for the party receiving or having access to such documents and
information to any person or entity except:
A.

Counsel of record for the parties;

B.

Employees of the parties or of counsel assigned to assist counsel in the conduct of
this cause and any appeal herein;

C.

Consultants or experts, and their subordinates, employed by a party or counsel to
assist counsel in this cause;

D.

The Commission, PUD and the AU designated by the Commission to conduct
proceedings herein.

Mi persons who may be entitled to receive, and who are afforded access to, any
“confidential” information or “highly sensitive confidential” information by reason of this
Agreement shall not reveal or discuss such documents or information, or any information
contained therein, to or with any person who is not eligible to receive such documents or
information pursuant to the Protective Order, this paragraph and authorized to receive such
documents or information pursuant to Paragraph 5.
Mi such persons shall use their best efforts to keep the information secure in accordance
with the purpose and the intent of this Agreement. To this end, persons having custody of any
such information shall keep the documents under lock and key or otherwise properly secured
during all times when the documents are not being reviewed by a person authorized to do so.
5.
Prior to producing the “confidential” information, as contemplated in Paragraph 4
and 6, or producing for review the “highly sensitive confidential” information, as contemplated
in Paragraph 7 to any person authorized to be given and provided access to such information
pursuant to this Agreement, counsel for the requesting party shall notify counsel for the
producing party of the intent to make such disclosure, stating with particularity the name, title
and job responsibilities of the person to whom disclosure will be made and the purpose of such
disclosure. In addition, requesting counsel shall require the person to whom disclosure is to be
made to read a copy of this Agreement, sign the same and deliver it to counsel for the producing
party before disclosure is made and, if no objection thereto is registered to counsel requesting the
same by 5:00 p.m. on the second business day after actual notice, then disclosure shall follow. If
objection is made, the disclosure shall not occur until the objection is withdrawn or until an
appropriate order of the Commission is issued. Objection shall be made only after good faith
review by counsel for the producing party. The procedure for objecting shall not apply to
disclosure to Commission employees. Any objection shall be set for hearing, if necessary, on the
next available motion docket.

6.
“Confidential” documents and information shall be produced by the producing
party by delivering a copy thereof to counsel for the requesting party.
7.
The following procedures apply with respect to production for review of “highly
sensitive confidential” information unless: (a) the producing and receiving parties agree
otherwise; or (b) otherwise required by the provisions of this Agreement.
On or before the date the response is due, the party producing information claimed to be
“highly sensitive confidential” information shall file with the Commission, and deliver to the
party that requested the information, a written statement that includes the following information:
(a) the identity of the party requesting the “highly sensitive confidential” information; (b) a
verbatim recitation of those data requests for which responsive information, in whole or in part,
is deemed to be highly sensitive information; and (c) a written statement that explains why the

information is “highly sensitive confidential” information.
Information claimed to be “highly sensitive confidential” information must be made
available at the responding party’s Oklahoma City, Oklahoma location, or another location
agreed by the parties or ordered by the AU or the Commission, on or before the date the
response is due.
The party producing information claimed to be “highly sensitive confidential”
information shall be responsible for monitoring the inspection of such information. The attorney
for the party requesting the information shall be responsible for monitoring any note taking
allowed under this Agreement. Extensive note taking shall not be permitted.
8.
A party may include “confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential” documents
or information of another party in, or as attachments to, prefiled testimony, but only if the
portion of the testimony, including at least the affected question and the attachments which state
the “confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential” information, and such other portions of the
testimony, if any, as in fairness should be redacted to protect the confidentiality of the
information, are segregated from the remainder of the testimony. Where such protected
documentation and/or information are redacted, the party claiming confidentiality shall file a
cover sheet to the redacted version(s) of such confidential testimony with the Commission. The
cover sheet shall be marked: “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION REDACTED--SUBJECT TO
PROTECTIVE ORDER N OKLAhOMA CORPORATION COMMISSION CAUSE NO. PU])
201400137.” A party which submits a confidential cover sheet shall initially serve a copy of the
complete prefiled testimony, including the unredacted portions, on the party whose
“confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential” information is affected. All other parties shall
initially be served only a copy of the redacted prefiled testimony without the confidential
portions, but annotated to clearly reveal that the testimony is not complete. If a party who is not
served the unredacted portions of prefiled testimony wants to obtain access to the protected
information and/or documents relating to that testimony, that party must request the unredacted
information and demonstrate it has signed this Agreement. The request shall be served on both
the party which filed the testimony and upon the party whose information is affected. A
requesting party shall be provided the unredacted portions of the prefiled testimony, pursuant to
7

Feb-17-2017 008029

Cause No. PUD 201400137— Protective Order
the mandates defined in this Agreement, by the party which filed the testimony, if the party
whose information is affected does not object to such disclosure, by 5:00 p.m. of the second
business day after actual notice of such a request. A failure to object has no effect other than to
authorize an unredacted copy of the confidential portion of the testimony to be served on the
requesting party. In the event of an objection, it shall be heard specially by the AU and no later
than the next available motion docket.
If a party intends to use “confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential”
9.
information on the record at the hearing of this Cause, the party shall give reasonable advance
notice to the AU or the Commission and to counsel for all other parties, and shall request an
in camera proceeding before the AU or the Commission, as appropriate. If “confidential” or
“highly sensitive confidential” information is admitted into evidence or taken as an offer of proof
or otherwise in such an in camera proceeding, the record of such in camera hearing, if thereafter
prepared, shall be marked “CONFIDENTIAL--SUBJECT TO PROTECTWE ORDER IN
OKLAHOMA CORPORATION COMMISSION CAUSE NO PUT) 201400137.” The portion of
the transcript shall be separately bound, segregated, sealed and withheld from inspection by any
person not bound by this Agreement, unless and until released from the restrictions of this
Agreement either through the written agreement of the parties, or after notice to the parties and
hearing, pursuant to an order of the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction.
10.
The receipt by any party to this cause of any documents or information which
have been designated as “confidential” or the receipt of access to any documents or to any
information designated as “highly sensitive confidential” pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall not be deemed to constitute an agreement that the documents or information produced are
“confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential.” Subsequent to the receipt of documents or
information marked “confidential” or of access to documents or information marked “highly
sensitive confidential” by any party to this Cause, the party receiving such documents or
information or access thereto may contest the claim of confidentiality.
11.
If a party, after review of the information designated as “confidential” or “highly
sensitive confidential,” wishes to contest such classification, a motion to that effect shall be filed
with the Commission identifying with particularity (but not disclosing) the information in
question. The parties seeking to have the information designated as “confidential” or “highly
sensitive confidential” shall file a response within five working days after receipt of the motion,
and shall have the burden of establishing the need for such designation. The parties are expected
to attempt to resolve such a dispute by negotiated agreement.
At the request of the AU, the responding party shall provide the documents claimed to be
“confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential” to the AU for an in camera review. Those
documents shall not be ified with the Commission. Such documents will not be accessible to the
other parties except pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, unless subsequently so ordered by
the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction. Disclosure shall be made as ordered or
otherwise agreed to by the responding and requesting parties.
12.
In the event a party determines that in order to protect the interests and
expectations of privacy and confidentiality of its customers, employees, agents or
$

representatives, it is necessary for such party to withhold the identification of such customers,
employees, agents or representatives, from any documents or. information produced, the
producing party may, in addition to taking any other action provided for in this Agreement,
redact the names and other types of information which specifically identifies such customers,
employees, agents or representatives from the documents and information it produces or
discloses to the other party. The fact of redaction must be clearly disclosed on the face of the
document produced or as part of the response made. If the party receiving documents or
information with such redaction disagrees with the necessity or appropriateness of such
redactions, it may seek resolution of such issue by the AU. Provided, however, that one
unredacted version of such documents or information shall be provided to counsel of record for
the party requesting such documents or information, but such counsel shall not duplicate such
unredacted documents or information or disclose the unredacted documents or information to
any other person, party or entity, including the persons or parties described in Paragraph 4 above,
without first seeking and receiving permission in advance from counsel for the producing party
or an order from the Commission allowing such disclosure or duplication.
13.
To the extent that such efforts will not damage a party’s presentation of its
position in this docket, each party shall use its best efforts to phrase deposition and other
discovery questions, prefiled testimony, questions asked on live examination of a witness, briefs,
other pleadings and oral arguments in a way which will eliminate or minimize the need for
documents in the record to be under seal, or for Commission proceedings in this docket to be
closed to the public. Any party intending to refer to “confidential” information or “highly
sensitive confidential” information during a Commission proceeding in this docket in a manner
which might require that such proceeding be closed shall as soon as possible provide advance
notice of this to the parties and the AU or the Commission, whichever is presiding over the
proceeding, identifying with particularity the confidential information involved.
14.
Upon completion of this proceeding, including administrative or judicial review
thereof, copies of all “confidential” documents furnished under the terms of this Agreement shall
be returned promptly to the producing party and any notes from “confidential” or “highly
sensitive confidential” information shall be destroyed. Counsel for the party, which made such
notes, shall certify to the producing party that such notes have been destroyed. Unless otherwise
ordered, such information including portions of transcripts from any depositions to which a claim
of confidentiality is made, shall remain under seal, shall continue to be subject to the protective
requirements of this Agreement, and shall be returned to the producing party at the conclusion of
this litigation. While in the custody of the Commission, these documents shall be marked
“CONFIDENTIAL--SUBJECT TO PROTECTWE ORDER TN OKLAHOMA CORPORATION
COMMISSION CAUSE NO. PUD 201400137”. They shall not be considered as records in the
possession of or retained by the Commission subject to public disclosure within the meaning of
the Oklahoma Open Records Act. If the Office of the General Counsel of the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission receives a request for public disclosure, pursuant to the Oklahoma
Open Records Act, 51 OS. §24A.1, et seq., of information claimed to be either “confidential” or
“highly sensitive confidential” (or any notes reflecting such information) then the recipient of
that request for disclosure shall, within one working day following receipt of that request, notify
the party whose information is affected that a request for public disclosure has been made. The
Office of the General Counsel of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission shall not release such

information publicly for ten calendar days, in order to allow the responding party time to pursue
any legal remedies that it may have, unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
15.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any party from: (a) requesting additional
relief from the Commission concerning the production, protection, disclosure or use of any
“confidential” or “highly sensitive confidential” documents or information in the event of
disagreements among the parties or their counsel which cannot be resolved by the parties or their
counsel; or (b) objecting to the production or disclosure of documents or information on grounds
that such documents or information are not subject to production or disclosure or are entitled to
protection from such production or disclosure under provisions of the Commission’s rules of
practice or other applicable law.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
OG&E submits its Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”) in both the Oklahoma and Arkansas
jurisdictions in compliance with the IRP requirements that have been established
pursuant to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s (“0CC”) Electric Utility Rules and
the Arkansas Public Service Commission’s (“APSC”) Resource Planning Guidelines for
Electric Utilities. This IRP is submitted in response to material changes in planning
assumptions that have occurred since the Company’s regular triennial IRP, submitted in
accordance with the Commissions’ rules in 2012.
The material change in planning assumptions that has occurred since the 2012
submittal involves specific environmental rules with which OG&E must now
comply. Those rules include the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule (‘MATS”), the Oklahoma Regional
Haze State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) and the EPA’s Regional Haze Federal
Implementation Plan (“FIP”).
OG&E and the State of Oklahoma appealed the EPA’s FIP in federal court. On May 27,
2014, the United States Supreme Court denied a petition to review a July, 2013
decision by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. That
Circuit decision upheld the
EPA’s rejection of the SO2 emission provisions of the Oklahoma Regional Haze SIP and
the implementation of the EPA FIP related to SO2 emissions instead. With the Supreme
Court order, the State of Oklahoma and OG&E have now exhausted all legal avenues in
their effort to gain approval from the EPA for a less costly compliance plan that was
used as one of the planning assumptions in the 2012 submittal.
The issuance of the Supreme Court decision also re-establishes Oklahoma’s (and
OG&E’s) time to comply with the Regional Haze rule that had been suspended during
the legal appeal process. OG&E must comply with those requirements by January
2019, a short deadline given the long development lead times required for compliance.
Before discussing the compliance alternatives available to the Company, it is instructive
to review OG&E’s efforts to dramatically reconfigure its resource portfolio since
announcing its “2020 Goal” in October 2007. The 2020 Goal established the objective
of deferring the addition of new fossil fuel capacity until at least 2020 and maintaining
flexibility to address future environmental regulations in the manner most beneficial to
our customers. OG&E’s strategy for meeting the 2020 goal included new wind energy,
additional transmission in western Oklahoma to enhance the delivery of wind energy,
new customer energy efficiency programs, smart grid supported demand response, and
terminating wholesale electricity sales contracts. Over time, OG&E has retired 237 MW
of aging and less efficient power plants, added 671 MW of wind energy and constructed
multiple transmission lines that support wind energy development in the region. OG&E
also restructured existing demand reduction programs, added a combination of new
energy efficiency and demand response programs, including the technology enabled

Feb-17-2017 008034

2014 Integrated Resource Plan DRAFT
-

SmartHours program, and announced the termination of 300MW of wholesale contracts
by 2015. As a result of these actions, OG&E’s customers have benefited in the short
term through lower costs and the Company is better positioned to address an uncertain
environmental future.
For this IRP, OG&E must now determine which of several alternatives meets the
requirements of the EPA FIP and MATS obligations, while serving the best long-term
interests of our customers in light of future environmental uncertainties.
This IRP identifies the best environmental compliance alternative based on a calculation
of the lowest, reasonable cost to our customers. In order to do so, the Company
performed an extensive update of its IRP models and planning assumptions in order to
produce an IRP that reflects the current operating and regulatory environment. This
included updates to its load forecast, demand-side resources, existing unit
characteristics, retirement plan, new unit costs and generating characteristics, emission
control costs, fuel prices, CO2 cost assumptions and Southwest Power Pool (“SPP”)
Integrated Marketplace (“ I M”) prices.
As further described in Section V. of the IRP, OG&E evaluated five alternative
environmental compliance plans that capture the range of possibilities including unit
replacement, installation of scrubber technology, and conversion of existing generation
from coal to natural gas. Each of these alternatives has been subjected to scenario and
sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of uncertainties associated with key input
assumptions including fuel prices and the potential impacts of future carbon regulation.
The results were evaluated against a set of portfolio objectives that included the
projected cost to our customers over a 30-year period and other important customer
objectives including fuel diversity and future regulatory risks.
This analysis indicated that the “Scrub/Convert” alternative is the best approach. The
“Scrub/Convert” alternative involves the installation of dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1
and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. It is the lowest
cost alternative in the base case and provides a compromise between the “Scrub”
alternative with its high CO2 risk and the “Convert” alternative that exposes customers to
high natural gas price risk. After considering all of the possibilities, OG&E selected the
“Scrub/Convert” alternative which is, in OG&E’s view, the lowest reasonable cost with
due consideration to the uncertainty associated with fuel and carbon prices.
This IRP also reflects the recently implemented SPP lM, which went live on March 1,
2014. The SPP lM includes a Day Ahead market and several other features that will
commit and dispatch resources and transmission flows to serve electricity loads across
the multi-state SPP footprint. While OG&E is still required to own or control sufficient
generation capacity to meet SPP planning reserve requirements, the Company now
obtains all of its energy through the SPP IM rather than relying on its own resources.
As a consequence, the evaluation of OG&E’s prospective resource needs incorporates
an analysis of generation resources, transmission constraints and market conditions for
the entire SPP region.

O%I—E’

In the context of environmental concerns, the SPP IM and the need to meet capacity
requirements, OG&E began to focus more closely on its Mustang plant. OG&E
concluded that retirement of the Mustang steam units in late 2017 and replacement with
new, efficient combustion turbines (“CT5”) at the existing Mustang site in 2018 and 2019
is the best course of action. The initial Mustang unit was built in 1950 and each of the
Mustang units have already operated well beyond the retirement age of nearly all units
in the United States of similar type and size. A significant failure could render the
existing units unavailable to meet load requirements for an extended period of time
and/or indefinitely.
OG&E chose the existing Mustang site as the location for the new CTs for several
reasons. Since it is close to OG&E’s largest load center, the site provides valuable
reliability support and voltage control functions. The site is also beneficial because of
existing infrastructure such as secure property, electric transmission and
interconnection facilities, a gas pipeline connection, roads, buildings, water lines, water
rights to support operation and maintenance of the plant, an existing workforce and
community support. In addition, retiring and replacing the capacity of the Mustang
steam units on the aforementioned schedule allows OG&E to take advantage of existing
site-specific environmental permits. Delaying replacement of these units will limit or
eliminate OG&E’s ability to permit the capacity that OG&E needs to meet SPP planning
capacity margin requirements at the Mustang site. The addition of new CTs at Mustang
will also enhance the development of additional wind in Oklahoma.
OG&E believes the IRP accomplishes a number of key objectives:
• Places the Company in compliance with Regional Haze and MATS requirements
within the prescribed deadlines.
• Provides a balanced approach of cost and risk while preserving fuel diversity and
ensures SPP capacity requirements are met.
• Preserves the strategic Mustang site, enhances the availability of Oklahoma
wind, preserves jobs, and provides reliability benefits in the SPP IM.
• Provides the best opportunity to hold down customers’ costs in a variety of future
circumstances.
OG&E takes very seriously its responsibility to provide reliable, reasonably priced power
produced in an environmentally responsible way. This IRP reflects OG&E’s plan to
meet federal mandates in a way that minimizes the impact on customers.
Unfortunately, all alternatives available to the Company increase customer costs. After
carefully considering all these factors, OG&E has decided to convert two coal-fired units
at the Muskogee Power Plant to natural gas, add scrubbers to the coal-fired units at the
Sooner power plant, and other pollution control equipment to other units, and replace
vintage natural gas steam units at the Mustang Power Plant with modern combustion
turbines.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Purpose of the IRP Submittal
OG&E submits this IRP pursuant to the CCC Electric Utility Rules and the APSC
Resource Planning Guidelines for Electric Utilities. OG&E submitted its last IRP in both
jurisdictions in October 2012. This submittal is being made primarily in response to the
EPA Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule (“MATS”), the US Supreme Court’s May
27, 2014 order that affirmed the EPA’s rejection of Oklahoma’s proposed SIP and
implementation of a FIP. As a result, in order to comply with the Regional Haze
requirements of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), OG&E must now comply with the EPA’s FIP.
As indicated in Figure 1, our 2012 IRP assumed that Oklahoma’s SIP would ultimately
be accepted by the EPA.

II. THE 2020 GOAL, SPP’S INTEGRATED MARKETPLACE, AND
OG&E’S ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES
This section reviews the actions that OG&E has taken to reconfigure its portfolio since
2007, SPP’s new Integrated Marketplace (“IM”) and its impact on OG&E’s resource
planning process, and the environmental challenges that must be addressed by OG&E.
The 2020 Goal and OG&E’s prior actions to meet that goal provide the foundation for
this IRP. OG&E’s customers are already using electricity more efficiently and shifting
their usage from peak to non-peak hours. OG&E will continue investments and
programs that achieve further gains on the customer side of the meter. The generation
fleet also is more efficient and produces far fewer emissions than it did in 2007.
Through the additions of wind energy, OG&E’s generation portfolio is more diverse than
it has ever been.

A. OG&E’s 2020 Goal Progress
The 2020 Goal established the objective to defer the addition of new, incremental fossil
fuel capacity until at least 2020 through a combination of wind energy, new energy
efficiency programs, smart grid-enabled demand response, and termination of
wholesale contracts and by doing so, defer the construction of new incremental fossil
fuel generation until 2020 despite the retirement of 237MW of aging and less efficient
generation. The specific changes undertaken by OG&E since the goal was announced
in the fall of 2007, including demand-side management (“DSM”) actions to date are
presented in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, OG&E added 671 MW of wind generation over this period bringing
CG&E’s total nameplate wind capacity to 841 MW. Load reduction from demand-side
resources increased by 266 MW and OG&E terminated 87 MW of wholesale contracts
over this period, further offsetting the amount of capacity that OG&E would otherwise
need in its portfolio. Additionally by May of 2015, OG&E will complete its exit from the
wholesale market with the remaining 300 MW of wholesale contracts being terminated.
Also, by 2015, over 300 MW of demand-side resources will be utilized through a

combination of energy efficiency and demand response programs, including the
technology enabled SmartHours program.
In addition to the actions taken to support the 2020 Goal, OG&E also retired several
units over this period without replacement: four circa-I 965 combustion turbines with a
total capacity of 56 MW at Enid, a 10 MW CT at Woodward, and a 171 MW gas steam
plant at Muskogee. Continued operation of the Enid and Woodward CTs, as discussed
in the 2012 IRP, would have required the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction
technology to bring NOx emissions within required limits.
These actions have significantly changed OG&E’s capacity and generation mix as
shown in Figure 3. Wind capacity represents nameplate capacity and does not
represent planning capacity margin.

B. SPP’s Integrated Marketplace
SPP launched its IM on March 1, 2014 after a decade of planning and development
efforts. The lM is designed to improve the efficiency of the electricity system across the
SPP footprint and to share those benefits with SPP members and their customers. The
IM represents the next step in the evolution of SPP from a regional reliability
organization at its founding in 1941 to becoming a Regional Transmission Organization
in 2004 to operating an Energy Imbalance Services (“EIS”) market in 2007.
The lM is a major enhancement to the market functions initiated by SPP in Match 2014.
In designing the IM, SPP has worked with stakeholders in an effort to benefit from the
experiences of other regional market designs, while reflecting the specific
circumstances of the SPP region, including the existing and potential resource base and
the objectives of the region’s state regulators. The IM is expected to contribute to mote
efficient transmission and generation capacity development, enhance the ability for both
buyers and sellers to hedge risk, and enhance reliability across the SPP footprint
through a regional balancing of supply and demand. SPP has projected that the IM will
generate approximately $45M to $100M of savings per year, to be shared among the
members. OG&E represents approximately 13% of the total load in SPP and expects to
realize a similar percentage of the overall market savings.
The IM will accomplish these various objectives through the following capabilities:
(1) a Day-Ahead Market with Transmission Congestion Rights;
(2) a Reliability Unit Commitment process:
(3) a Real-Time Balancing Market that supplants SPP’s EIS Market:
(4) a price-driven Operating Reserve Market; and
(5) a single SPP-wide Balancing Authority.
The IM does not operate a capacity market or conduct an annual regional process to
obtain incremental capacity, as is the case in certain other regions. OG&E will remain
responsible for ensuring that it has planning capacity sufficient to serve its peak load
requirements.
It must meet these capacity obligations through OG&E-owned
generation or contracts for capacity.
OG&E’s minimum capacity planning reserve margin continues to be established
pursuant to Section 4.3.5 of the SPP Criteria as follows:
Generation Reliability assessments examine the regional ability to
maintain a Loss of Load Expectation standard of I day in ten years. The
SPP capacity margin Criteria requires each control area to maintain a
minimum of 12% capacity margin for steam-based utilities and 9% for
hydro-based utilities.
Thus, OG&E is required to maintain capacity levels that allow for a minimum of 12%
margin between capacity and demand. This calculation is explained in Section 2.1 of
the SPP Criteria as represented in the following equation:

2074 Integrated Resource P/al?

Capacity Margin %

-

=

This obligation has not changed under the IM and is identical to the capacity planning
assumption that was reflected in OG&E’s 2012 IRP. However, OG&E and all other
Load Serving Entities now obtain all of their energy through the IM and pay hourly
locational marginal prices established by the market, rather than relying on owned or
contracted assets for energy. Also, OG&E sells all of its energy generated by its assets,
including contracted assets, into the IM so the IM will have a direct impact on (1) the
degree to which OG&E’s generation resources will be called upon to provide electricity
and (2) on the revenues that will result from SPP market compensation mechanisms
that establish hourly locational prices to be paid to each generation source.
As a result, in order to evaluate new generation resources in the IRP, it is necessary to
forecast the market prices for the region that will apply to electricity generated by OG&E
units and to purchases from the market to serve OG&E’s load. As described in Section
IV E, OG&E utilizes Ventyx PROMOD IV, an electric market simulation tool which
incorporates generating unit operating characteristics, transmission grid topology and
constraints, to estimate future energy prices in the SPP IM. Further, market conditions
such as availability of diverse generation resources, fuel pricing and emission costs will
impact market pricing and this is reflected in the design of scenario analyses that
capture the uncertainty in these areas.

C. Environmental Compliance Obligations
The electricity production activities of OG&E are subject to a stringent, complex and
interrelated set of existing Federal, state and local laws and regulations, especially
those governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can restrict or
impact OG&E’s business activities in many ways including requiring remedial action to
mitigate certain emissions and discharges, restricting the way OG&E handles or
disposes of its wastes, regulating future construction activities to mitigate harm to
threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of
emission control equipment.
Existing and potential environmental obligations have a major impact on OG&E’s
resource plan and have been examined in several prior IRP submittals. OG&E’s 2014
IRP is designed to meet the existing environmental obligations while at the same time
also considering the potential of future environmental regulations, even though certainty
of these rules, including the potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, are not
settled.

1. Compliance with the MATS and Regional Haze Rules
The focus of OG&E’s existing environmental obligations is on the emissions of SO2,
NOx, and certain hazardous air pollutants. Of immediate concern are the MATS and
Regional Haze rules, which combine to impact OG&E’s coal and gas steam units.

a) Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule
The MATS rule, issued on December 16, 2011, includes numerical standards for
particulate matter (as a surrogate for toxic metals), hydrogen chloride and mercury
emissions from coal-fired boilers. The regulations also include standards for dioxins
and furans. Compliance is required by the April 16, 2015 effective date unless
extended for one year by the state environmental regulator. OG&E requested and has
received a one-year extension for compliance to April 16, 2016 from the Oklahoma
Department of Environmental Quality.
OG&E plans to comply with MATS by installing activated carbon injection (“ACI”) at five
coal-fired units. The cost of installing ACt on all five of OG&E’s coal units is estimated
to be $24 million. OG&E does not believe any retrofits are necessary at its five coalfired generating units to comply with the particulate matter and acid gas emission limits.
Because of the relatively low cost of the ACI systems and the three-year difference in
the compliance timeframes for MATS and Regional Haze, OG&E determined that
installing ACI at the five coal-fired units was the least-cost choice irrespective of a
subsequent decision with respect to its coal units under the Regional Haze compliance
plan. In order to comply with the April 16, 2016 MATS compliance deadline, OG&E has
begun the engineering and design process to support ACI installation and is currently
scheduled to finish the construction and installation by January 2016.
b) Regional Haze and the Federal Implementation Plan
On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued final amendments to its 1999 regional haze rule.
Regional haze is visibility impairment caused by the cumulative air pollutant emissions
from numerous sources over a wide geographic area. These regulations are intended to
protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United
States. In Oklahoma, the Wichita Mountains are the only area covered under the
regulation. However, Oklahoma’s impact on parks in other states must also be
evaluated.
As required by the Federal regional haze rule, the State of Oklahoma evaluated the
installation of Best Available Retrofit Technology (“BART”) to reduce emissions that
cause or contribute to regional haze from certain sources within the state that were built
between 1962 and 1977. Certain units at the Horseshoe Lake, Seminole, Muskogee
and Sooner generating stations were evaluated for BART. On February 18, 2010,
Oklahoma submitted its SIP to the EPA, which set forth the state’s plan for compliance
with the Federal regional haze rule. The Oklahoma SIP included requirements for
reducing emissions of NO and SO2 from OG&E’s seven BART-eligible units: Seminole
Units 1, 2 & 3, Muskogee Units 4 & 5, and Sooner Units 1 & 2.1 The SIP also included
an approved waiver from BART requirements for all eligible units at the Horseshoe Lake
generating station based on air modeling that showed no significant impact on visibility
1

Muskogee Unit 6 was not in existence prior to August 7, 1977; therefore, Unit 6 is not a
BART-eligible source. Unit 6 commenced commercial operation in mid-1984.

in nearby national parks and wilderness areas.
review and approval.

The SIP was subject to the EPA’s

On December 28, 2011, the EPA rejected portions of the Oklahoma SIP and issued a
FIP related to Regional Haze SO2 emission requirements. While the EPA accepted
Oklahoma’s BART determination for NOx in the SIP, it rejected the SO2 BART
determination with respect to the four coal-fired units at the Sooner and Muskogee
generating stations. In its place, the EPA implemented its FIP requiring that OG&E
meet an SO2 emission rate of 0.06 pounds per MMBtu within five years. OG&E can
meet the proposed standard by either installing and operating Flue Gas Desulfurization
equipment (scrubbers) or fuel switching to natural gas at the four affected units.
The State of Oklahoma and OG&E challenged the FIP at the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the EPA’s rejection of the SO2
emission portion of Oklahoma SIP and the EPA’s implementation of the FIP in July
2013. Review by the United States Supreme Court of the 10th Circuit’s decision was
sought and denied by the Supreme Court on May 27, 2014, causing the 10th Circuit’s
decision to become final. One positive of these various legal proceedings is that they
extended the compliance deadline for the SO2 portion of the FIP until the end 012018.2
As explained in Section V, OG&E has modeled several scenarios that would meet the
Regional Haze FIP SO2 emission limits, including scrubbing all four affected units,
converting or replacing all such units to natural gas and a combination of scrubbing and
conversion/replacement.
c) Initial Actions to Comply with the MATS and Regional Haze Rules
OG&E has already taken certain actions to address these existing requirements by
installing emission control equipment at eight of its units. Specifically, OG&E is
installing low NOx burners at seven units (Muskogee 4 & 5, Sooner I & 2, and Seminole
1, 2 & 3) and ACI at its five coal-fired units. These investments are shown in Table 2.

2. Future Environmental Compliance Risks
Environmental regulations are expected to become ever more stringent, requiring
increased capital expenditures for control equipment and increased costs to operate the
control equipment and to report compliance. Many of the new and more stringent
requirements are focused on coal-fired generation. Some environmental advocacy
organizations have a stated goal of ending the generation of electricity with coal by midcentury to address climate change.
With respect to new or proposed environmental rules or actions by the EPA that would
affect OG&E’s generation portfolio, they are numerous and include: (i) EPA’s CrossState Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”) that restricts NO emissions during the ozone
season from May 1 through September 30, (ii) EPA’s proposed Coal Combustion
Residuals Rule (‘CCR”) that will affect the disposal of coal ash from coal plants, (iii)
EPA’s new rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulating intakes of water
used as a coolant in the power production process, (iv) EPA’s proposed standards for
greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, (v) EPA’s adoption in the future
of more stringent standards for pollutants covered by the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards, and (vi) additional reviews by the EPA of future SIPs by Oklahoma to
comply with regional haze provisions of the CAA. In addition, OG&E could be impacted
by the Endangered Species Act and New Source Review Litigation.
a) Cross-State Air Pollution Rule
On July 7, 2011, the EPA finalized CSAPR to replace the former Clean Air Interstate
Rule that was remanded by a federal court as a result of legal challenges. The final rule
would require 27 states to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and
particulate matter pollution in other states. On December 27, 2011, the EPA published
a supplemental rule (“Supplemental Rule”), which would make five additional states,
including Oklahoma, subject to CSAPR for NOx emissions during the ozone-season
from May I through September 30. Under the rule, OG&E would have been required to
reduce ozone-season NOx emissions from its electrical generating units within the state
beginning in 2012. Both rules were challenged in court by numerous states and utilities.
On December 30, 2011, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the applicability of
both rules. On August 21, 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court vacated CSAPR and ordered
the EPA to promulgate a replacement rule. The Supplemental rule was not vacated
with the original rule but remained stayed at the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals pending
briefing of the merits. After further appeal of the original CSAPR to the U.S Supreme
Court, the Supreme Court, on April 29, 2014, reversed and remanded the case to the
D.C Circuit Court to resolve a number of outstanding technical issues. Until the
outcome of the court process including the briefing of the merits on the Supplemental
Rule is known, the CSAPR requirements remained stayed but not vacated for the State
of Oklahoma. The low NOx combustion equipment being installed for regional haze
also will help meet the CSAPR requirements contained in the Supplemental Rule. At
this point, it is not clear if those measures by themselves will be enough to satisfy
CSAPR or if OG&E will have to consider installing additional controls or purchasing
emission credits.

b) Coal Combustion Residuals
The EPA published the proposed OCR rule in June 2010, establishing standards for the
management and disposal of byproducts of coal combustion in power plants (coal ash,
etc.). EPA has a December 2014 deadline to finalize the rule. As proposed, the rule
contains three primary options, including one program to regulate CCRs as hazardous
waste, and two options to regulate CCRs as non-hazardous solid wastes. The OCR rule
could require additional investment in the existing coal plants depending on the option
that is included in the final rule. The OCR rule could restrict OG&E’s ability to manage
its coal ash through beneficial re-use, thus increasing the cost of managing coal ash.
c) Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act
The EPA published a proposed cooling water intake rule in April 2011 under Section
316(b) of the Clean Water Act. A final rule was released on May 19, 2014. This rule
establishes technological standards for the design and operation of cooling water intake
structures at existing electric generating facilities to lessen their impacts on fish and
other aquatic life. Facilities have the ability to choose one of seven options for meeting
best technology available requirements for reducing impacts but may also be required
to conduct further biological studies to help their permitting authority determine whether
and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce the number of
aquatic organisms entrained by cooling water systems. This decision process would
include public input. OG&E is still evaluating the final rule to determine the impact on
OG&E facilities.
d) Greenhouse Gas Regulations
The EPA proposed emissions standards for greenhouse gas emissions from new
electric utility fossil-fuel steam generating units and combustion turbines on January 8,
2014. The EPA has determined that partial carbon capture and storage is the “best
system of emission reduction” for new coal plants and that new natural gas combined
cycle technology will suffice for natural gas turbines, specifying limits for emissions of
002 for each fuel source. The EPA is expected to issue a final rule by the end of
2014. On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed a rule for existing power plants. This
proposed rule would require the State of Oklahoma to propose a plan to reduce 002
emissions in the state by 35.5% in 2030 compared to 2012, with an interim requirement
for an average 33% reduction between 2020 and 2029. OG&E is still reviewing the
details of this important rule and the rule will not be final until June 1, 2015. However,
OG&E ‘s plan to convert two coal units to natural gas will reduce CO2 emissions from
OG&E’s generation fleet, positioning the Company to provide a meaningful contribution
to any state 002 reductions ultimately required by the EPA.
OG&E has accounted for the considerable uncertainty regarding regulation of
greenhouse gas emissions by including a carbon tax in its sensitivity analyses.
e) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”)
The EPA is required to set NAAQS designed to be protective of human health and the
environment for six specific pollutants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review

14
Feb-17-2017 008050

2014 Integrated Resource Plan

Update DRAFT
-

OGJ—I

each NAAQS every five years. As a result of these reviews, the EPA periodically has
taken action to adopt more stringent NAAQS for those pollutants. For example, in 2010,
the EPA revised the NAAQS for 502 and N02, establishing new one-hour standards
that are significantly more stringent than the prior standards. If any areas of Oklahoma
were to be designated as not attaining the NAAQS for a particular pollutant, OG&E
could be required to install additional emission controls on its facilities to help the state
achieve attainment with the NAAQS.
In addition to tightening standards, the EPA has proposed new ways to determine
whether areas are in attainment with the NAAQS. This new process uses computer
modeling instead of actual monitored emissions to determine whether violations of the
standards may occur. If EPA implements such a process, such computer models may
be used to move areas of Oklahoma into non-attainment status. As of the end of 2013,
no areas of Oklahoma had been designated as non-attainment for pollutants that are
likely to affect OG&E’s operations. However, in recent years, monitored ozone levels in
Oklahoma have been very close to a NAAQS exceedance level and this assessment is
reviewed each year and measured against the standard that is currently in effect.
f) Future Requirements under Regional Haze
When EPA disapproved Oklahoma’s BART determinations under Regional Haze for
OG&E’s four coal-fired units, it said it was taking no action on whether the state had
satisfied the reasonable progress requirements of the regional haze provisions in the
Clean Air Act. Environmental groups have now sued EPA to force it to take action on
this aspect of Oklahoma’s regional haze plan. Subject to court approval, EPA has
agreed to issue a proposed rule by Nov. 15, 2014 and a final rule by Sep. 4, 2015. The
rule could be used to adopt emission limits that are more stringent than BART or to
apply emission limits to sources that were not subject to BART, although the impact on
OG&E, if any, cannot be determined until there is a specific proposal.
The Regional Haze Rule provides for several planning periods prior to the 2064
deadline for achieving the national goal of natural visibility conditions in Class I Federal
areas. States are required to develop a SIP for each planning period. The second
planning period commences in 2019. It is anticipated that, during the second planning
period, additional reductions of emissions affecting visibility may be required, or
reductions may be requited from additional sources, beyond those regulated in the first
planning period.
g) Endangered Species Act and other Federal Laws
Certain federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection
to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for
significant civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized activities that result in harm to or,
harassment of certain protected animals and plants, including damage to their
habitats. If such species are located in an area in which OG&E conducts operations, or
if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, OG&E’s operations
and development projects, particularly transmission or wind projects, could be restricted
or delayed, or OG&E could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced a proposed rule to list the Lesser Prairie
Chicken as threatened on November 30, 2012. The decision applies to a 5-state area
including parts of Oklahoma where OG&E has undertaken the development of certain
large transmission projects. On March 10, 2014, OG&E enrolled in the Western
Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ Range-Wide Conservation Plan for the
Lesser Prairie Chicken. This Range-Wide Conservation Plan consists of industryspecific conservation practices that apply to new and existing projects and activities in
the impacted area. The Range-Wide Conservation Plan has been approved by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service and incorporated as part of the agency’s final decision on
March 27, 2014 to list the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. More than 32
companies have enrolled in the Range-Wide Conservation Plan.
h) New Source Review Litigation
On April 26, 2011, the EPA issued a notice of violation alleging that 13 projects
occurred at OG&E’s Muskogee and Sooner generating plants between 1993 and 2006
without the required new source review permits. On July 8, 2013, the Department of
Justice at the request of the EPA, filed a complaint for declaratory relief against OG&E
in U.S District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma (Case No. CIV-13-690-D)
alleging that OG&E did not follow the Clean Air Act procedures for projecting emission
increases attributable to eight projects that occurred between 2003 and 2006. This
complaint seeks to have OG&E submit a new assessment of whether the projects were
likely to result in a significant emissions increase. The Sierra Club has intervened in
this proceeding and has asserted claims for declaratory relief that are similar to those
requested by the United States. The United States has filed a motion for summary
judgment against OG&E, and OG&E has filed a motion to dismiss the claims by the
United States and the Sierra Club. These motions have been briefed and are waiting
for a decision from the court.
If OG&E does not ultimately prevail in these proceedings, the EPA and the Sierra Club
could seek to require OG&E to install additional pollution control equipment, including
scrubbers, baghouses and selective catalytic reduction systems.
On August 12, 2013, the Sierra Club filed a separate complaint against OG&E in the
U.S District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma (Case No. 13-CV-00356) alleging
that OG&E’s modifications made at Unit 6 of the Muskogee generating plant in 2008
were made without obtaining a prevention of significant deterioration permit and that the
plant has exceeded emissions limits for opacity and particulate matter. The Sierra Club
seeks a permanent injunction preventing OG&E from operating the Muskogee
generating plant. On November 4, 2013, OG&E filed a Motion to Dismiss and on March
4, 2014, the District Court issued an Order dismissing the prevention of significant
deterioration claim but allowing the claim relating to opacity and particulate matter
emissions to continue. On May 21, 2014, OG&E filed a motion for summary judgment
on the remaining opacity and particulate matter claims. At the same time, Sierra Club
issued a notice of intent to assert additional opacity and particulate matter claims

monitoring and emission limit claims not only against Muskogee 6, but also against
Muskogee Units 4 and 5.
If OG&E does not prevail in these proceedings, the Sierra Club could seek penalties
and could seek to requite OG&E to install additional pollution control equipment,
including baghouses.

III. IRP OBJECTIVES AND PROCESS
A. IRP Objectives
OG&E strives to develop a lowest reasonable cost resource plan that will allow it to
meet its capacity obligations over the 30-year planning horizon at the lowest reasonable
cost (as represented by the Net Present Value of Customer Cost or “NPVCC”) with due
consideration to the uncertainties attributable to many of the planning assumptions
including fuel prices and future environmental regulations. Every generation technology
has a differing set of capital costs, O&M costs, and operating characteristics (i.e., the
ability to start quickly or run at less than full loading) and these differences are captured
in the IRP modeling and reflected in NPVCC calculations.
A primary planning objective that OG&E relies on to address the uncertainties in fuel
and emission prices is fuel diversity. Fuel diversity helps to ensure stability in prices
and reliability in electric supply, protecting the company and customers from short term
contingencies such as fuel unavailability. Natural gas may have limited availability
during times of extreme cold weather when well heads can freeze, impacting both the
amount of flowing gas and the ability of pipelines to reach carrying capacities. Coal can
also have delivery issues which threaten supply, including production problems at the
mine site and railroad transportation issues. Catastrophic weather events such as
floods, tornado, and weather extremes can impact both fuels.
Fuel diversity also provides protection from fuel price fluctuations caused by market
conditions as well as longer term contingencies such as changes in regulatory practices
that can drive up the cost of a particular fuel.
OG&E’s goal is to meet SPP’s planning capacity margin requirements with a fuel
diverse generation fleet. The sensitivity of portfolio NPVCCs to price forecasts depends
to a considerable degree on the nature of the generation mix. For example, the NPVCC
of a portfolio that is heavily weighted toward natural gas plants will be relatively
insulated from the impact of carbon prices but will swing widely in response to volatility
in natural gas prices. Similarly, the NPVCC of a portfolio that is heavily dependent on
coal resources will be relatively sensitive to carbon prices and also be at risk should
regulation of CO2 take a less flexible form than a market-based approach. Finally, wind
energy provides very little capacity value (and may not generate energy when it is most
needed and most valuable).
Thus, while a portfolio with a lower NPVCC is clearly preferred, a portfolio with the
lowest NPVCC in any scenario may not represent the lowest reasonable cost portfolio,
even if all portfolios are equally reliable. A portfolio that mitigates risks may be
preferred to a portfolio that has moderately lower NPVCC but exposes customers to
greater risks that actual costs will end up being much higher under a different set of
plausible assumptions. The most desirable portfolio can be characterized as a “robust”

portfolio because it will produce an acceptable NPVCC outcome under a wide range of
plausible assumptions.
To identify the robust portfolio, OG&E is guided by the following objectives:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)

Reliability: satisfy SPP’s planning capacity margin requirements throughout
the 30-year planning horizon;
Compliance with Existing Environmental Rules: satisfy the requirements of
MATS and the Regional Haze FIP;
Expected Cost to Consumers: lowest reasonable NPVCC subject to
satisfying other IRP objectives;
Fuel Diversity: maintain a reasonable balance among natural gas, coal, and
wind, and other economically viable renewable resources;
Operational Flexibility: maintain or increase the ability of OG&E’s portfolio to
respond at SPP’s direction to localized reliability issues (through quick-start
peaking units, for example);
Portfolio Age: maintain a reasonable balance of capacity as measured by
expected remaining asset life;
Demand-Side Resources: maximize the reliance on economic demand-side
resources;
Exposure to Fuel and Emissions Prices: consider the sensitivity of NPVCC
based on different assumptions regarding fuel and emissions prices;
Exposure to Future Environmental Regulation: consider the potential that
future environmental regulations (particularly regulations intended to
address greenhouse gases) may result in costly environmental compliance
solutions.

B. IRP Process
The IRP “process” also remains largely unchanged although it is now necessary to
estimate the operation of SPP’s IM by forecasting the market prices for the region that
will apply to electricity generated by OG&E units and to purchases from the market to
serve OG&E load. A seven-step process is used to accomplish the IRP objective,
illustrated in Figure 4.

IV. ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS
OG&E performed an extensive update of its IRP models and assumptions in order to
produce an IRP that is “current”. This section describes the major assumptions: (A)
OG&E’s 2013 load forecast including demand-side resources, (B) Supply-Side
resources from existing units and their transition to new resources and environmental
control alternatives, (C) SPP transmission additions, (D) Fuel price forecast and C02
price forecast used in sensitivity analysis, and fE) SPP Market Price forecast under
several scenarios and sensitivities.
A. 2013 Load Forecast and Demand Side Resources
OG&E prepared the September 2013 load forecast that is presented in Appendix A. The
load forecasting framework relies on independently produced forecasts of service area
economic and population growth, actual and normal weather data, and projections of
electricity prices for price-sensitive customer classes. The final energy and demand
forecast includes Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) jurisdictional
wholesale contracts as adjustments to the forecast on top of the load forecasting
modeling results. All OG&E wholesale contracts are scheduled to expire by mid-2015.
Estimates of demand-side resources, incremental to those already reflected in the
econometric-based forecast, are developed based on the continued growth in existing
OG&E programs and new programs. Growth in Distributed Generation (“DG”) is not
currently included in the load forecast but is considered in the market price sensitivity
section of this report. A more complete discussion of the topic is presented there.
1. Load Forecast

—

Energy and Peak Demand

Load forecasting includes projections of annual energy sales and peak demand.
a) Energy Sales Forecast Methodology
The retail energy forecast is based on retail sector-level econometric models
representing weather, growth and economic conditions in OG&E’s Oklahoma and
Arkansas service territories. Historical and forecast economic variables (drivers) used in
the models are provided by the Center for Applied Economic Research at Oklahoma
State University.
b) Peak Demand Forecast Methodology
The load responsibility forecast relies on an hourly econometric model reflecting the:
• Impact of different weekdays on hourly system load;
• Impact of different summer months on hourly system load;
• Influence of heat buildup during heat waves;
• Impact of the combined effects of humidity and warm temperatures; and
• Non-linearity in the load and temperature relationships at very high temperatures;

Historical and forecast weather-adjusted retail energy sales are the main driver for the
peak demand forecast projections.
c) Energy Sales Forecast
The energy sales forecast adds FERC wholesale sales contracts and tine tosses to the
retail econometric model forecast. The forecast is based on normal weather in both
Oklahoma and Arkansas. The energy sales forecast is shown in Table 3. The declines
shown between 2015 and 2016 are attributable to the expiration of wholesale contracts.

participation in existing programs and the addition of new programs. The impact of prior
years’ energy efficiency and demand response efforts is assumed to be captured in the
econometric forecast of retail requirements. These incremental contributions are
described in the following paragraphs.
2. Demand Side Management
OG&E is required to periodically propose, administer and implement a demand portfolio
of energy efficiency and demand response programs.4 Programs implemented after
2012 are not embedded in OG&E’s annual load forecast and are subtracted from the
baseline forecast to calculate the final energy and peak demand forecasts.
While EE programs do provide some demand reduction, EE programs are designed to
educate and encourage customers to make behavioral changes and purchasing
decisions that will provide long-term benefits in managing their energy usage. DR
programs are designed to send customers price signals encouraging them to reduce
their demand during system peak.
a) Energy Efficiency
For more than 30 years, OG&E has successfully managed several DSM programs such
as: Positive Energy Home, Geothermal Home, Heat Pumps, Rate Tamer and Power
Factor Correction. A renewed focus on energy efficiency in the last ten years targeted
areas such as: weatherization of homes for low and fixed income customers, residential
air conditioner tune-ups and duct seals, commercial lighting, and incentive payments to
commercial and industrial customers who reduce peak demand. The benefits of the
programs are reported annually to the 0CC and the APSC. Collectively, these programs
have reduced energy by more than 160,000 MWh and demand by more than 40MW.5
As noted above, these historical reductions have been captured in the econometric load
forecast models and therefore are embedded in OG&E’s annual load forecast.
Table 6 and Table 5 present the 2012 combined Oklahoma and Arkansas demand
portfolio estimates of the impact of energy efficiency programs on the load forecast.
OG&E will continue promoting and monitoring these programs and will revise future
estimates as appropriate.

OG&E presented the 2013-2015 Demand Portfolio in PUD 201200134. An overview can be

b) Demand Response
DR programs are designed to encourage customers to reduce their load during peak
loading periods. OG&E offers a Real Time Pricing option which communicates hourly
prices for the next day to encourage customers to shift their energy usage to non-peak
periods. The seasonally and time-differentiated Time-of-Use program communicates
varying prices to customers promoting them to shift their energy use habits. These
reductions have been captured in the econometric load forecast models and therefore
are embedded in OG&E’s annual load forecast.
The demand response of OG&E’s 2013-2015 demand portfolio continues efforts to
expand the SmartHours and Integrated Volt Var Control (“IVVC”) programs6. The
SmartHours program integrates technology and pricing to help customers reduce
energy usage at peak times. The program utilizes the Advanced Metering Infrastructure
(AMI) to securely send price signals across the network and through the smart meter,

Communicating Thermostat allows customers to set a temperature schedule in addition
to receiving and responding to price changes automatically while maintaining full control
of their thermostat settings and overall usage at all times. IVVC is a system of devices,
controls, software and communications products used to manage OG&E’s distribution

In Cause No. PUD 200800398, OG&E restructured the event-based programs to offer
the Load Reduction Rider. This pricing schedule replaced previous event based tariffs
while lowering the customers’ annual on-peak period maximum demand requirement
from 500 kW to 200 kW and above. The customer enrollment period starts in January
and ends March 31st OG&E plans to steadily grow this program for the next several
years.

SmartHours, IWO and the Load Reduction Rider impacts are not reflected in the
annual load forecast and are subtracted from the baseline forecast to calculate the final
energy and peak demand forecasts. Table 8 and Table 7 show OG&E’s system-wide
estimate of energy and demand reductions possible for the next ten years. OG&E
continues to evaluate these programs to look for mote demand reduction opportunities
but believes the current programs aggressively reduce system peak demand.

As shown in Table 8, the potential contribution of SmartHours is significant in 2015,
illustrating the success of actual and projected customer enrollments and performance.
Once these programs are fully implemented, OG&E will be able to assess the potential
for additional customers and reductions through SmartHours. The growth in SmartHours
from 2016 on is based on an anticipated enrollment from customer growth on OG&E’s
system.

B. Supply-Side Resources
As described in Section II, OG&E remains obligated to maintain capacity sufficient to
serve its peak load requirements, either through OG&E-owned generation or contracts
for capacity. OG&E’s capacity planning reserve margin is 12% and must be satisfied by
existing resources (net of any planned retirements) or new capacity resources. OG&E’s
existing resources and potential new resources (by technology) are presented in this
section.

1.

Existing Resources

OG&L owns generation and obtains capacity and energy from several PPAs. OG&E’s
generation resources include coal-fired units, gas-fired steam units, gas-fired combined
cycle (“CC”) units, quick start gas-fired combustion turbine (“CT”) units, and wind
facilities. OG&E owns 51% of the Redbud CC plant and 77% of the McClain CC plant.
All other fossil plants are fully owned by OG&E. OG&E is the operator of all of its fossil
plants, including McClain and Redbud.
OG&E also owns three wind facilities:

Centennial, OU Spirit and Crossroads. Following SPP Criteria 12, OG&E’s December
30, 2013 net peak capacity is 6,347 MW. By 2015 OG&E will complete efficiency
improvements at McClain and Redbud realizing an increase of approximately 55 MW of
capacity.
OG&E’s PPAs include 320 MW from the qualifying facility AES plant at Shady Point that
burns coal and 120 MW from the natural gas fired combined cycle PowerSmith plant.
OG&E currently has four wind energy purchase power agreements: Sooner Wind at 50
MW, Keenan at 151 .8 MW, Taloga at 130 MW and Blackwell at 60 MW. OG&E’s fossil
fuel PPAs contribute 440 MW of peak capacity while PPA’s from wind contribute 13MW
due to their non-dispatchable qualities. OG&E’s portfolio of electric generating facilities
is presented in Table 9.

2. Retirement Assumptions
Historically, OG&E assumed for planning purposes that each generating unit in its fleet
would perform for the entire study period. However, the aging of OG&E’s fleet
necessitated a change in this approach and the 2072 IRP contained end of life dates for
the units located at the Mustang, Horseshoe Lake and Seminole plants.
Subsequent to the 2012 submittal, OG&E focused more closely on the Mustang plant.
This was in large part because these units are some of the oldest generation units of
their type and size operating in the US.7 In addition, OG&E expects the operation of
Mustang units in the SPP IM to evolve even further from their original purpose resulting
in a seasonal role with increased cycling for short periods. Operating older steam units
in a manner not consistent with the purpose for which they were originally designed will,
as a practical matter, tend to shorten the estimated useful life for those units.
OG&E’s more specific analysis of the Mustang units’ age as compared to their peers in
the industry and their anticipated future operations caused the company to conclude
that the risk of significant failure for these units is substantial and increasing every year.
Moreover, if failure occurs in any one of several critical components of a Mustang unit,
including but not limited to the turbine, boiler headers, external high energy piping, or a
generator step up transformer, the units could be unavailable to meet load requirements
for an extended time or even permanently. This is, in part, because replacement parts
for units of this age are often no longer supported by manufacturers and, if they can be
reproduced at all, must be specially made at a significant expense and lead time.
Taking into account the probability and potential impact of equipment failure, as well as
the associated safety issues for our members OG&E concluded that, while the Mustang
units should remain operational in the near term, retiring all of the Mustang units by the
end of 2017 is the prudent course of action. This date represents the earliest
generation can be designed, permitted, procured and installed at the Mustang location.
OG&E believes that utilizing the existing Mustang site to replace the 463 MW of reserve
planning capacity being retired is prudent for a variety of operational reasons. First, the
Mustang plant serves a crucial reliability support function because of its location within
the load area. Mustang is located only 9 miles from downtown Oklahoma City, within
OG&E’s largest load center. Under extreme conditions such as those identified in the
Department of Homeland Security report Terrorism and Electric Power Delivery System8
and recently reported in the Wall Street Journal9, the Mustang units are available to
supply power to a load “island” that could include the critical national security site of
Tinker Air Force Base. The Mustang site plays an especially important role in the

$

For example, according to SNL, Mustang unit 4 is the oldest gas steam unit of its size in the United States.
Also, there is only one unit in the U.S. older than Mustang Units I and 2 of similar size and only six units in the
U.S. older than Mustang 3 of similar size. All of the Mustang steam units are already well beyond the average
life for this type of unit (52 years).

service restoration process. The Company’s service restoration plan designates
Mustang as a key contributor in re-energizing the system in black start situations and
helping get our other units back on-line in those events. Locating quick-starting
combustion turbines at Mustang would speed up the system restoration process and
allow OG&E to restore the system faster in the event of black start situation. Having
generation close to OG&E’s largest load center also mitigates OG&E’s exposure to
prolonged storm-related outages on the transmission system.
Mustang also provides valuable voltage control on the transmission system. Given the
close proximity of the Mustang plant to Oklahoma City, and since the Mustang plant is
configured to flow power into both the 69 kV and 138 kV transmission systems, it serves
a critical role as a dynamic resource to stabilize voltage on the part of our transmission
system that directly serves the majority of our customers. The Mustang location allows
the transmission system operators the ability to operate within North American Electric
Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) and regionally-mandated criteria, and mitigates the
prospect for sudden, substantial voltage collapses on the system.
In addition, Mustang has an existing infrastructure in place to support operation and
maintenance of the plant including: secure property, electric transmission and
interconnection facilities, a gas pipeline connection, available water supply with water
rights, roads and buildings.
Mustang’s existing environmental air permits provide the opportunity to use the
permitting process for gas-fired generation on OG&E’s system. This opportunity is
based on a “netting analysis” whereby the emissions from replacement generation are
“netted” against the historical emissions from the existing units. Since operation of the
existing Mustang units is expected to decline in the IM market, permitting the new units
in the near term will maximize the amount of replacement generation capacity that can
be installed at the Mustang site.
The company concluded that CTs, with their ability to start quickly and react faster to
SPP market signals, will be dispatched more hours in the SPP market and produce
more revenue (to the benefit of OG&E customers). Similarly, with the growing amount
of intermittent wind generation within the SPP footprint, these new CT units will be able
to react quicker to changes in wind patterns and will complement the growing wind
generation in the state and region. As the amount of wind generation and solar energy
in the SPP market grows, this type of agile gas generation is expected to be even in
more demand. The need for additional quick start CT capacity has been identified in
several of SPP’s Integrated Transmission Plans including the latest plan. OG&E also
determined that no CT’s are available for acquisition in the region.
For all of these reasons, OG&E believes that retirement of the Mustang steam units at
the end of 2017 and the replacement of those units with CT’s at the existing site is the
best course of action. These assumptions are used in the IRP analysis. In addition,
OG&E has performed an analysis comparing this approach to other options for retiring

The results of that analysis are

3. Emission Control Technologies
Several existing generation units will require emission control equipment to comply with
federal and state emissions regulations. Compliance with Regional Haze requirements
under the EPA’s FtP will require either the installation at Sooner I and 2 and Muskogee
Units 4 and 5 of Dry Scrubber technology or conversion to natural gas. Several coal
and gas-fired units will require installation of Low NOx Burners to comply with Regional
Haze and potentially for CSAPR rules that are soon to be finalized. Activated Carbon
Injection will be utilized to address MATS. Estimates for natural gas transportation fees
to support the potential conversion from coal to natural gas at both Muskogee and
Sooner plants have also been developed to capture the complete cost associated with
this environmental compliance alternative. OG&E anticipates that a competitive bidding
process will be necessary to construct new pipeline capacity to serve Muskogee to
support the conversion. Cost estimates for emission control technologies considered in
this IRP are based on information provided by Sargent & Lundy, shown in Table 10.

4. New Build Supply-Side Resources
OG&E utilized the 2014 Energy Information Administration (“ElK) Annual Energy
Outlook Early Release to identify proxy supply side resources. The proxy units are
meant to represent a generic type of unit and not the specific manufacturer or
technology to be placed into service. The EIA data was used only to screen viable
generation technologies to consider. Two requirements were established for selecting
new resources to analyze: (1) whether the technology was proven, and (2) whether the
cost was economically viable. Resources had to satisfy both requirements in order to be
subject to further analysis.
a) Proven Technology
In addition to providing construction and operating costs associated with the new
resources, the Annual Energy Outlook also discusses how some technologies are more

28
Feb-17-2017 008064

2014 Integrated Resource Plan

—

Update DRAFT
-

developed than others. For example, while carbon capture and sequestration is
discussed as a solution to reduce 002 emissions, repeated utility scale facilities have
not been developed and operated. Therefore this technology is not considered proven
and is not included in a resource portfolio. The advanced units in the Annual Energy
Outlook are typically not technologies proven on a commercial scale.
b) Cost
The second requirement considers the cost of the new resource option. For example,
the Biomass CC unit has a cost of $8,365/kW. This is significantly more expensive than
other renewable or base load resource options; therefore it would not be a reasonable
addition to a portfolio. The supply-side resource options and screening requirements are
presented below in Table 11. For purposes of the cost/scale criterion, technologies that
have overnight capital costs of less than $2,500/kW are assumed to pass the test.

Update DRAFT

As described in the following paragraphs, OG&E supplemented the EIA data for both
wind and central solar facilities through a Request for Information (“RFI”) in the case of
wind energy and further research with respect to central solar facilities. In both cases,
the costs are lower than suggested by the EIA analysis.
C)

2013 OG&E Wind Energy RFI

To gain market intelligence of wind energy pricing and availability, in 2013, OG&E
issued a Wind Energy RFI. Respondents were “encouraged to be creative with the size
and terms” of agreements. Due to uncertainties associated with wind energy in the SPP
IM the RFI stated “OG&E has a preference for terms that reflect the wind energy
suppliers incur all curtailment risk, including those for economic purpose”. Responses
were received from nine (9) companies that offered twenty (20) locations throughout
Oklahoma and Kansas. Despite the request, none of the responses were structured
such that the suppliers took the curtailment risk. In contrast, all of the offers included
take-or-pay provisions that would also make the developer whole on production tax
credits in the event of a curtailment other than force majeure. Pricing averaged
approximately $22/MWh and is less than that provided in previous RFI’s with
respondents citing improved technology resulting in increased capacity factors and
reductions in turbine prices.
d) Central Solar Photovoltaic
Central solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) requires 10-15 acres per MW. Two types of Solar PV
systems were evaluated10 to estimate potential costs. The first type of system was a
fixed tilt system that has an estimated cost of about $2.25 per watt and 18.5% capacity
factor. This unit also had less coincidence with peak so the capacity value was
estimated at 50%. The second unit evaluated, a single axis tracking system, is mote
expensive at nearly $2.50 per watt but appears to be more beneficial to customers since
it operates with an estimated capacity factor of 24% and has a higher coincident
capacity value of 70%. The estimated maintenance cost is $25 $40 per kW-year and
includes an inverter replacement once every 10 years. These assumptions are
summarized in Table 12. There are numerous considerations that still need to be
analyzed before wide-scale implementation can be achieved. As more information
becomes available, OG&E will conduct a mote in-depth analysis to test the viability of
central solar PV.

5. Transmission to Connect New Supply-Side Resources
Supply side resource options often require transmission investments depending on
location and the configuration of existing transmission facilities. In an effort to develop a
more comprehensive estimate of the costs of new generation, OG&E has identified
proxy sites and estimated the transmission expansion costs that would be associated
with these sites. These sites were chosen for analysis purposes only and no
determination has been made on future specific locations.
a) Thermal Generation
A Transmission Service study was performed by OG&E for the purpose of analyzing the
transmission constraints associated with the addition of one 562 MW generating unit to
the McClain generation plant. The McClain plant is located in McClain County near
Newcastle, Oklahoma. The addition of the unit will require expansion of the McClain
substation to include a 345kv Bus. The estimated expansion cost is $20 million as
detailed in Table 14.

Contingency Analysis was performed to determine if any overloads were present due to
new generation. One overload was detected in the Western Farmers Electric
Cooperative area and transmission network upgrades will be required to correct the
overload. There may be additional cost that will be determined in the SPP study
process.
OG&E also examined the potential of adding CTs at the Mustang site and determined
that this would not require any additional transmission capacity beyond what is already
located at Mustang to allow for transmission service.

C. New Transmission Facilities
OG&E’s transmission system is directly interconnected to seven other utilities’
transmission systems at over 50 interconnection points. Indirectly, OG&E is connected
to the entire Eastern interconnection through the SPP regional transmission
organization. The SPP footprint covers 370,000 square miles and its 74 members
serve over 6 million customers across all of Kansas and Oklahoma and parts Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Texas. In compliance with
FERC Order 890 for transmission planning, SPP performs annual expansion planning
for the entire SPP footprint. OG&E provides input to the SPP planning process, and
SPP is ultimately responsible for the planning of the OG&E system.
The 2014 SPP Transmission Expansion Plan11 (“STEP”) summarizes Integrated
Transmission Planning (“ITP”) efforts including regional reliability, local reliability,
generation interconnection, and long-term tariff studies due to transmission service
requests. The purpose of the ITP process is to maintain reliability, provide economic
benefits and meet public policy needs in both the near and long-term to create a costeffective, flexible and robust transmission grid with improved access to the SPP region’s
diverse resources. The ITP is a three-phase iterative three-year process that includes a
long-term 20-year assessment, a 10-year assessment and a near-term assessment.
The first phase, the ITP 20 Year Assessment (“ITP2O”) is used as a roadmap for the
development of a long-term transmission plan over a 20-year horizon. The ITP2O
focuses on the continued development of the SPP region’s extra high voltage (“EHV”)
transmission system to reduce congestion and enable low cost generation access to
SPP’s members. SPP will not issue any Notifications to Construct as a result of the
ITP2O. The ITP2O plan process is repeated every three years.
The second phase of the ITP process is the ITP 10-Year Assessment (“ITP1O”), which
analyzes the transmission grid over a 10-year time frame. The ITP1O utilizes economic
and reliability analysis to find solutions for local reliability upgrades, mitigate congestion,
improve access to markets and eliminate potential criteria violations.

The third phase of the ITP process is the annual ITP Near-Term Assessment (“ITPNT”).
The goals of the ITPNT are to preserve SPP transmission grid reliability and to create
an effective near-term plan for the SPP footprint. ITPNT will identify potential problems
under normal and first contingency scenarios in compliance with NERC Reliability
Standards, SPP Criteria, and local planning criteria. Mitigation plans to meet regional
reliability needs will be developed and necessary reliability upgrades will be identified
for approval and construction.
Transmission improvements identified in the 2014 STEP were included in the
transmission models for this IRP. Some of the benefits provided by these improvements
include reliability and the capacity for expansion of Oklahoma’s wind energy.
Transmission system expansion provides benefits to members throughout SPP;
therefore, the costs of all projects constructed in SPP are shared through various cost
allocation methods, depending on the type of project.
The Balanced Portfolio and Priority Projects include transmission upgrades of 345 kV
projects with regional benefits that exceed project costs.12 These projects provide
benefits through production cost savings, reduced congestion, and integration of SPP’s
East and West regions, among others. The costs associated with these projects are
spread broadly across the SPP footprint because they benefit the entire region. The
2014 STEP included the following major 345 kV transmission projects for OG&E to
construct. A more descriptive list of those projects can be found in Schedule J.

The 2014 Annual Energy Outlook Early Release assumes that there are no explicit
federal regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, therefore CO2 emission costs
were only included in the analysis as a sensitivity.
OG&E developed its CO2 cost forecast by calculating, for each year from 2020 on, the
CO2 cost that would equate the marginal cost of generation from a natural gas
combined cycle power plant and a scrubbed coal-fired power plant, given their relative
CO2 emission rates. This price forecast was developed to create price parity between
efficient gas generation and emission controlled coal generation. OG&E based this
analysis on its forecasted natural gas and coal fuel prices, typical plant heat rates, and
typical plant variable non-fuel O&M costs. The resulting CO2 cost forecast shown in
Table 16.

E. Integrated Marketplace Prices
OG&E and the other members of SPP are now participating in the SPP lM which has
implications for the way OG&E plans for generation resources. Since OG&E will sell its
generation into the market and buy all of its load requirements from the market, it is
necessary to calculate future market prices to reflect in the modeling process. OG&E

utilizes Ventyx PROMOD IV®, an Electric Market Simulation tool which incorporates
generating unit operating characteristics, transmission grid topology and constraints, to
determine future energy prices in the SPP IM.

1. Price Scenarios
Market conditions such as availability of diverse generation resources, fuel pricing and
emission costs will impact market pricing. To capture the uncertainties associated with
these market drivers, OG&E has developed three market scenarios that it believes are
plausible outcomes. The likelihood that SPP members will be required to control
emissions on their coal plants was used to define the three scenarios:
• Base Case
All announced plans to control emissions on SPP coal units are
included in the models. Also, it is assumed all coal units in SPP smaller than 200
MW and older than 1977 will be converted to natural gas. All other coal units
with and without emission control are assumed to be available in the IM.
—

•

High Conversion
Starting with the Base Case scenario, all coal units in SPP
that have not announced plans to control emission are assumed to be converted
to natural gas.

•

Low Conversion
All announced plans to control emission on SPP units are
included in the models. All other coal units with and without emission control are
assumed to be available in the IM.

The resulting average annual Locational Marginal Prices (“LMPs”) for the three
scenarios are shown in Figure 6.

2. Market Price Sensitivities
Potential market prices due to the uncertainty of natural gas prices, the potential for a
CO2 tax and load requirements were considered through the development of
sensitivities. These sensitivities were developed by changing each assumption
associated with the uncertainties listed below one at a time in the model. The result
was four sets of market prices that reflect these uncertainties.

a) Discussion of Distributed Generation
DG is defined as electricity production that is on premise or close to the customer load
and is interconnected to the utility distribution system. The most common DG
technologies currently being adopted include solar photovoltaic, fuel cells and micro-

turbines. In most applications, DG can be a substitute product for grid-supplied
electricity.
DG growth is increasing in certain states due to policies favorable to DG, tax incentives,
state-level equipment rebates and relatively high electricity prices. Since these
conditions are not prevalent throughout the SPP footprint, the near term impacts of DG
on SPP load and energy prices are not estimated to be material.
However, suppliers of DG systems are structuring their product financing to be more
affordable. Additionally, technological advancements and market dynamics are
expected to reduce the overall costs of DG systems over the next decade. As a result
DG systems will likely become more attractive to customers within OG&E’s service
territory and SPP. Given these factors, there is potential for the adoption of DG systems
to grow more rapidly in five to ten years.
In modeling the market price sensitivity, OG&E considered the impact to SPP market
prices if energy from DG systems reduced total SPP load by an incremental 1% per
year over the next ten years for a total of 10% reduction by 2024.

V. RESOURCE PLANNING MODELING AND ANALYSIS
This section describes the resource planning analysis that OG&E has performed by
applying the process described in Section III. All analyses begin with the assumption
that OG&E is obligated to acquire capacity to meet its SPP capacity planning margin
requirement of 12% as described in Section II.
OG&E relies on the Ventyx PROMOD IV® software to model the SPP IM. OG&E
performed base case, sensitivity and scenario analyses based on the assumptions that
are described in Section IV. These model runs produce an estimate of the 30-year
NPVCC which represents one of the most important IRP objectives
producing the
lowest reasonable cost for OG&E’s customers. The sensitivity and scenario analysis
results contribute to the assessment of the portfolio’s ability to satisfy other IRP
objectives, including the value of fuel diversity. Overall, the model results inform
OG&E’s judgment as to the lowest reasonable cost resource portfolio.

A.

OG&E’s Capacity

Planning Obligation

As described in section II, the SPP capacity planning margin is 12% and considers all
resources currently owned or under contract. If expected resources do not reach the
level of customer demand plus the minimum 12% margin, additional resources or a
reduction in load responsibility is required. The results are presented in Table 17.

B. Environmental Compliance Analysis
This section presents the multi-step process used to analyze various environmental
compliance alternatives. These steps include the identification of potentiat portfolios to
meet both environmental compliance and longer-term capacity needs followed by
detailed modeling analyses including scenario and sensitivity analyses. The final step is
the application of IRP objectives and judgment to the set of model analyses to identify
the lowest reasonable cost plan.
1. Development of Portfolios
Although the EPA has specified in the FIP that OG&E should limit emissions to comply
with Regional Haze, there are several alternatives that should be considered before
deciding on the lowest reasonable cost plan. Since the compliance plans do not result
in an increase in capacity, it is necessary to combine each plan with a capacity
expansion plan before determining which combined compliance/expansion plan will be
the best plan for OG&E and its customers. As described below, OG&E has identified
five potential Regional Haze compliance alternatives and three potential expansion
plans for a total of 15 portfolios to subject to the Ventyx modeling analysis.
a) Regional Haze Compliance Alternatives
OG&E identified five alternatives for controlling SO2 emissions and complying with the
Regional Haze rule as established in the FIP by the 2019 compliance year. Each
alternative uses different technologies to achieve required levels of emission reductions,
as outlined in Figure 8 that represent variations of three fundamental alternatives:
installation of dry scrubbers, conversion of the coal units to natural gas, and
replacement of the coal units with new combined cycle plants.
Figure 8: Regional Haze Compliance Alternatives

• Scrub Sooner I by 2018 and Sooner 2 by 2019
• Convert four coal units to gas by 2019
• Scrub Sooner I by 2018 and Sooner 2 by 2019
• Replace two Muskogee coal units with new CCs by 2019
• Replace four coal units with new CCs by 2019

Each of these compliance plan alternatives assume that Low NO Burners are installed
on the 7 Regional Haze impacted units (the four coal units and the three gas steam

Seminole units) by 2017 and that ACI is installed on the coal units by the April 2016
MATS deadline to achieve compliance with respect to mercury standards.13
b) Expansion Plan Options
Three expansion plans were developed by considering the SPP 12% planning capacity
criteria. As explained in the Retirement Assumptions section, the Mustang units will be
retired and options for replacement are analyzed as part of the overall future expansion
plan. All expansion plans examined are consistent with OG&E’s “2020 Goal” with no
incremental fossil fuel generation added to the resource portfolio until 2020.
OG&E utilizes a screening process as described in Section IV to narrow the options to
those that are feasible to OG&E. In this screening process, Combined Cycle units and
Combustion Turbine units met all the screening criteria for consideration. OG&E
obtained more specific unit data from Sargent and Lundy in order to model the
expansion units in the SPP IM. The CCs and CTs were then distributed across the 30year forecast period with in-service dates as necessary to meet OG&E’s projected
capacity needs. Each of the three primary options adds capacity beginning in 2018 to
meet the capacity need that will result from the retirement of the Mustang units. They
represent an all CC-option (“CC”), a CT followed by CCs (“CT”), and an option that
reflects the flexibility offered by smaller sized Cl’s by spreading them out over 2 years
along with a mix of CTs and CCs “(Spread CT”). These options are presented in Table
18.

2. Portfolio Modeling Analysis
The modeling analysis determines customer costs as measured over the 30-year
forecast period. The portfolios are first analyzed using the “Base Case” set of forecast
assumptions, before testing the impacts of alternative sets of assumptions by
performing scenario and sensitivity analyses. The production cost with market impact of
each portfolio is determined utilizing PCI GenTrader® software with a model set-up that
represents OG&E’s generating unit characteristics and operating constraints. The
OG&E generators are dispatched against the IM price forecast to simulate operations in
the SPP IM. The return on rate base and non-production expenses associated with
each portfolio is then added to production costs with market impacts to determine the
customer costs as shown in Figure 10.

As shown in this figure, the “Replace” alternatives are considerably more expensive
than the “Convert” alternatives. The “Scrub” and “Convert” alternatives are relatively
close (as well as the combined “Scrub/Convert” alternative). There is also minimal
difference among the three expansion options although they are consistently ranked
from lowest cost to highest cost as follows: Spread CT, CT, and CC. The expansion
options do not appear to influence the comparison among environmental compliance
alternatives. For the remaining analysis shown in this report, the Spread CT expansion
plan will be used since it is the least cost option. To better understand the dynamics
between compliance alternatives it is helpful to consider the customer cost components
of the three lowest cost compliance alternatives as identified in Figure 12.

As shown, the alternatives that include scrubbing have higher return on rate base and
expenses but lower production cost with market impact. The lower production cost with
market impact reflects the margins that customers receive from OG&E selling coal
generation into the market. The alternatives that include converting coal to natural gas
have lower return on rate base and expenses but higher production cost with market
impacts because OG&E has less coal generation to sell into the market. Comparing the
production cost with market impact of the three compliance alternatives illustrates the
value of coal generation as compared to market prices.
The next step in the analysis is to consider how these portfolios perform when subject to
different IM price scenarios and sensitivity analyses around fuel prices, carbon prices,
load forecast and capital costs.
b) IM Market Scenario Analysis
As described in Section III, OG&E developed three market scenarios that were defined
to capture the uncertainty of other SPP IM participant responses to environmental
compliance requirements with respect to their coal units.
OG&E’s compliance
alternatives were tested in each market scenario to determine the impact that other
market participants could have on decisions made by OG&E. The Spread CT expansion
plan is used with each compliance alternative for the market scenario combinations
illustrated in Figure 13.

The “Convert” compliance alternative is impacted by a change in market prices by about

due to OG&E having less coal generation to sell into the SPP market or to hedge

two charts it is clear that the scrub alternatives offer increased savings as market prices
increase and thus provide a hedge against higher market prices due to diversification.
c) Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analysis involves changing a single input variable of the Base Case and
measures the impact of the change in that specific variable. The variables changed in
the sensitivity analyses are the Natural Gas Prices, Load for SPP members, CO2 Prices
and capital cost of emission control technologies as described in section III. The Spread

As expected, compliance alternatives that rely on converting from coal to natural gas
are impacted by gas price sensitivity the most and compliance alternatives that rely on
scrubbing coal units are impacted by gas price sensitivity the least. The reverse is true
for CO2 price sensitivity as a carbon tax would hit coal unit costs the hardest. Low load
has very little impact on all compliance alternatives though the largest impact is on the
convert alternative since lower load in SPP would free up low cost generation in the
market resulting in reduced load costs. Sensitivity to capital costs has a relatively low
impact as compared to natural gas and C02 price sensitivity but it does have the
greatest impact on the scrub compliance alternatives as they have a higher capital cost.

3. Lowest Reasonable Cost Plan
Given the relatively modest differences among the three lower-cost environmental
compliance alternatives and the varying results of the C02 and gas price sensitivities,
OG&E concludes that the Scrub/Convert alternative offers the lowest reasonable cost.
This determination was based on the least cost/risk plan that best meets the
comprehensive list of objectives identified by OG&E. This is an appropriate conclusion
despite the fact that the Scrub/Convert is not the lowest cost plan in any of the six
sensitivity cases presented in Table 20. Rather, it is the second lowest cost option in all
six cases, whereas the Scrub and Convert options have a lower cost than the Replace
options in all of the cases. In order to operate Muskogee 4 and 5 as gas units a natural
gas pipeline into the Muskogee plant will need to be constructed. OG&E expects that
through a competitive bidding process a third party would construct the pipeline and
charge a transportation fee for the service.
It should also be noted that acquisition of an existing 500 MW combined-cycle plant
could be an alternative to the conversion of a Muskogee unit. OG&E has acquired two
existing combined-cycle plants over the past decade (McClain and Redbud) and
continues to monitor CC plants across the SPP region. However, it should also be
noted that our analysis indicates that the acquisition cost of this alternative would have
to be very aggressive in order to compete with the “Convert” alternative, less than
$250/kW for a new highly efficient plant. Older CC plants with higher heat rates would
make sense only at lower acquisition costs. Thus, it appears that it isn’t a viable
alternative as OG&E believes no combined cycle plants are available at the acquisition
cost necessary make this alternative economical.
Overall, the lowest reasonable cost plan is the Scrub/Convert compliance alternative
with Spread CT expansion plan. This portfolio provides the best overall performance
when measured against the set of IRP objectives.

C. Wind Energy Analysis
OG&E considered including wind generation as an element of the environmental
compliance plan analysis but determined that it would not add any incremental insights
that would affect the analysis or recommendation. The primary consideration is the
absolute requirement that OG&E replace the capacity provided by the existing coal units
with a like amount of capacity in order to meet its load obligations. SPP only recognizes
approximately 5% of nameplate wind generation capacity for capacity margin purposes,
implying that 10,000 MW of wind would be needed to replace just one of OG&E’s 500
MW coal units. In addition, wind generation serves little purpose in complementing the
coal units, as once modified with environmental compliance technology (i.e., the dry
scrubbers), wind generation will not reduce the emissions rates of these units. OG&E’s
coal units will resume dispatch at a high capacity factor within the SPP market.
This does not imply that wind energy will not continue to serve a critical role in OG&E’s
portfolio and indeed it is likely that OG&E will increase its reliance on wind energy over
the coming decade, particularly after transmission constraints are addressed over the

47

2014 Integrated Resource Plan

Update DRAFT
-

next two years. The fact is that wind technology and associated capital costs are
continuing to improve and may indeed reach levels where wind energy tax credits are
no longer necessary to support growth in wind energy. Here as in previous IRP’s, wind
generation is evaluated based on customer savings.
While analysis indicates that wind energy may provide energy cost savings, these
savings are dependent on assumed lM prices and wind energy curtailments. Based on
recent experience with wind energy, there is considerable risk with both pricing and
curtailments and the respondents to our 2013 RFI declined to assume this risk. We
expect that lM circumstances will change as new transmission capacity is placed in
service.
With the implementation of the SPP IM and consolidation of the balancing authorities
there is considerable uncertainty as to the impact on the operations of wind generators
in SPP. Several utilities in SPP recently added or are in the process of adding more
than 2,000 MW of wind in and around Oklahoma. These additions of wind generation
will most likely impact congestion charges and reduce energy prices during times when
wind energy is produced. Also, curtailments due to reliability and economic reasons
may increase. Given these uncertainties, OG&E has made a decision not to pursue
additional wind generation at this time. OG&E will continue to monitor the market and
revisit its decision as more is understood of the uncertainties.
D. Central Solar Analysis
Combining the costs of the investment and future maintenance expenses, the 30-year
net present value of the cost of 10 MW of central solar is around $35 million. This cost
can then be compared to the expected revenues from the solar unit operating in the
various market price scenarios and sensitivities. As shown in Figure 18, the cost of solar
is about twice the amount of the potential revenues, confirming that central solar is not a
viable option for OG&E at this time.

E. Conclusions from Resource Planning Analysis
Based on this resource planning analysis, OG&E has determined that the following
strategy will provide the greatest benefits to OG&E’s customers:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Continue to aggressively pursue demand-side resources;
Scrub Sooner Units 1 and 2;
Convert Muskogee 4 and 5 to natural gas;
Defer expanding wind energy for at least two years, or until transmission
constraints are relieved and there is greater certainty as to the value of wind
in the SPP IM; and
(5) Replace Mustang Units 1-4 (463MW) with ten net 40MW (net 400MW)
natural-gas fired combustion turbine units over the course of two years,
beginning in 2018.
V

When considered as a comprehensive resource plan, this combination of actions
addresses OG&E’s future requirements in a lowest reasonable cost manner and
leverages prior OG&E actions that have been made while it implemented the 2020
Goal.

1. Activated Carbon Injection
The installation of ACI equipment for mercury removal is planned to be complete on all
coal units by April 2016.

2. Low NO Burners
By early 2017, OG&E plans to complete installation of Low NO burners with overfire air
on 7 units (Muskogee 4 & 5, Sooner 1 & 2, Seminole 1, 2 & 3) to reduce emissions that
cause or contribute to regional haze. Installation has been completed on Muskogee unit
5 and Sooner units 1 and 2.

3. Dry Scrubbers at Sooner
Dry scrubbers for 502 removal will be installed on Sooner 1 by 2018 and Sooner 2 by
2019. OG&E believes the installation of dry scrubbers will keep the Sooner plant in
compliance with the federal requirements for 502 emissions.

4. Convert Muskogee 4 & 5 to Natural Gas
Muskogee 4 & 5 will be converted to natural gas by 2019. OG&E believes the
conversion from coal to natural gas will satisfy the federal requirements for SO2
emissions.

B. Mustang Unit Retirement and Replacement Units
OG&E plans to retire the existing Mustang plant in 2017 and replace with ten 40MW
natural-gas fired combustion turbine units over the course of two years. The first of the
replacement units are planned to come online in 2018.
C. Demand Side Management Plan
OG&E plans to continue to expand Energy Efficiency programs and expects growth in
Demand Response programs. OG&E depends on the Demand Side Management plan
to maintain an adequate planning capacity margin in SPP and to achieve the “2020
Goal
D. Renewable Generation
OG&E will continue to monitor market conditions and implementation feasibility for
renewable generation options. We will consider new projects with reasonable and
manageable price and risk characteristics that satisfy our generation needs.

completed on Muskogee unit 5 and Sooner units I and 2.
Dry Scrubbers at Sooner
Dry scrubbers for SO2 removal will be installed on Sooner I by 2018 and Sooner
2 by 2019. OG&E believes the installation of dry scrubbers will keep the Sooner
plant in compliance with the federal requirements for SO2 emissions.
Convert Muskogee 4 & 5 to Natural Gas
Muskogee 4 & 5 will be converted to natural gas by 2019. OG&E believes the
conversion from coal to natural gas will satisfy the federal requirements for SO2
emissions.
Mustang Unit Retirement and Replacement Units
OG&E plans to retire the existing Mustang plant in 2017 and replace with ten 40MW
natural-gas fired combustion turbine units over the course of two years. The first of the
replacement units are planned to come online in 2018.
Demand Side Management Plan
OG&E plans to continue to expand Energy Efficiency programs and expects growth in
Demand Response programs. OG&E depends on the Demand Side Management plan
to maintain an adequate planning capacity margin in SPP and to achieve the “2020
Goal.”
Renewable Generation
OG&E will continue to monitor market conditions and implementation feasibility for
renewable generation options. We will consider new projects with reasonable and
manageable price and risk characteristics that satisfy our generation needs.

Transmission system expansion provides benefits to members throughout the SPP;
therefore, the costs of all projects constructed in the SPP are shared through various
cost allocation methods, depending on the type of project.

Schedule K

Resource Plan Assessment

This IRP assessed the need for additional resources to meet reliability, cost and price,
environmental, and other criteria established by the 0CC, the State of Oklahoma, the
APSC, SPP, NERC, and FERC. All criteria were met by all portfolios considered in this
IRP, in the base line condition. These criteria were also met in scenarios and
uncertainties which included variations in load growth, fuel prices, emissions prices,
environmental regulations, technology improvements, demand side resources, and fuel
supply, among others. This plan provides a comprehensive analysis of the proposed
options.

Schedule L

—

Proposed Resource Plan Analysis

This IRP demonstrates that all proposed alternatives meet all planning criteria as
outlined in Schedule K. The proposed action plan outlined in Schedule G best meets
these criteria. Documentation of the planning analysis and assumptions used in
preparing this analysis are described in Schedule I.

Schedule M

-

Physical and Financial Hedging

Currently, OG&E’s Fuel Cost Adjustment tariff provides OG&E customers’ effective
protection against fuel price volatility as shown in Chart 1. Additionally, OG&E has a
diverse mix of generation assets as outlined in Section IV of this report. The sensitivity
analysis in Section V illustrates the advantages of generation diversity and the impact of
the fuel volatility.

Financial Hedging of a commodity such as power plant fuel is aimed at reducing the
volatility in price. Financial hedging comes at a cost in the form of transaction costs,
margin calls and premiums required to lock in pricing. OG&E’s customers have been
protected to a large extent from the historic volatility in natural gas prices by OG&E’s
portfolio approach to fuel and purchased power. As a result, the Company does not
believe it to be prudent at this time to incur the additional costs associated with financial
hedging.
On May 15, 2014, OG&E filed its annual Fuel Supply Portfolio and Risk Management
Plan with the 0CC as part of Cause No. PUD 200100095. The filed document can be
found at the 0CC.

2013 Load Forecast

Executive Summary

Executive Summary
This report presents Oklahoma Gas & Electric Services’ (OG&E) 2013 Load Forecasts. It
describes both energy and peak demand forecasting models developed by OG&E with input
from OG&E’s Load forecasting Team.

The 2013 retail sales forecast utilized the revenue class-based econometric modeling framework
that has been in place for over a decade. The 2013 load responsibility peak demand forecast is
based on an hourly econometric model of weather and economic effects on OG&E’s hourly load
responsibility series. The hourly modeling approach has been used since the 2000 forecast.

The load forecasting framework relies on independently produced forecasts of service area
economic and population growth, actual and normal weather data, and projections of OG&E
electricity prices for price-sensitive customer classes. The load forecast contains the energy
efficiency impact expected from the anticipated future implementation of national energy
efficiency standards for appliances, lighting products and equipment. The final energy and
demand forecast includes Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdictional
wholesale contracts as post-modeling adjustments. (All OG&E wholesale contracts are
scheduled to expire by mid-2015.) OG&E Demand Side Management Programs are now
included in the final energy and demand forecasts as post-modeling adjustments.

The economic data, on which the forecast relies, indicates the economy in OG&E’s service
territory has experienced a strong recovery since the Great Recession. Regional economic
indicators have outpaced those at the national level over the past few years. Economic activity
has moderated somewhat recently, but the economic forecast shows that growth is expected to
accelerate again in the near term. A primary reason for the expected uptick is an anticipated
increase in oil St gas drilling and pipeline activity over the next 2 years.

The energy and demand forecasts through 2023 are shown in tables on the next pages. The retail
energy forecast is anticipated to grow at an average annual rate of 1.12%. The final energy sales
forecast, after adjusting for OG&E DSM programs, projects an average annual growth at 0.52%.
Retail peak demand is anticipated to grow at an average annual rate of 0.92% over the next
decade. The final demand forecast after adjustments is nearly flat across the 10 year forecast
horizon.

2013 Load Forecast

Introduction

1 Introduction
The 2013 load forecast offers a ten year projection for energy, peak demand and customer
growth. The 2013 retail sales (energy) forecast utilized the revenue class-based econometric
modeling framework that has been in place for over a decade. The 2013 load responsibility peak
demand forecast is based on an hourly econometric model of weather and economic effects on
OG&E’s hourly load responsibility series. The econometric model used for customer growth
relies heavily on population growth projections in OG&E’s service territories.

The load forecasting framework relies on independently produced forecasts of service area
economic and population growth, actual and normal weather data, and projections of OG&E
electricity prices for price-sensitive customer classes. The final energy and demand forecast
includes federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdictional wholesale contracts as
post-modeling adjustments. (All OG&E wholesale contracts are scheduled to expire by mid2015.) OG&E Demand Side Management Programs are now included in the final energy and
demand forecasts as post-modeling adjustments.

A simplified process map, as shown in figure 1, shows how historical data is integrated with
external forecasts of the future. This modeling step first tests previous assumptions in a
regression analysis to historical performance (this is also called the backcast). Assumptions are
adjusted as needed to produce the future forecast for each revenue class. Modeling adjustments
are made to the forecast to incorporate additional changes before the final forecast is produced.

2013 Load Forecast

2 Economic Outlook
KEY TAKEAWA’tS:

s

Oklahoma economic activitj’ licis leveled off recent!)’, bitt it is expected to pick up in
2014 due to growth in the Energj’ Sector.
C’onsiimers’ spending has increased and is expected to modestly increase in the near
term.
Employment growth in Okialitmia has outpaced the nation, and is expecteui to show
contintied strength in the next few rears.

2.1 Economic Summary
Oklahoma entered the Great Recession behind most of the country, and it has been recovering
slightly ahead of the rest of the nation. Recently, economic activity in the state has leveled off,
but it is expected to resume adding gains in the near future. A modest national recovery has led
to increasing demand for products that are typically exported from the region (energy, aerospace,
manufacturing, agriculture, etc.). Relatively healthy activity in the energy sector continues to
drive the Oklahoma economy and should provide continued momentum for gains in income and
employment across all sectors of the state economy.

2.2 Underlying Economic fundamentals
Consumer spending has risen in the past year and has been especially strong among restaurants
and hotels, while showing little change among retailers and auto dealers. Manufacturing activity
has improved somewhat with additional, but moderated gains expected in the near future.
Transportation activity has been relatively flat, while sales in the high-tech services sector have
risen slightly. The residential real estate market continues to improve with increased sales,
construction, and prices, while the commercial real estate sector has continued to slow. Banks
have reported slightly higher loan demand and improved loan quality, although non-performing
loan problems exist throughout the state. The Agricultural sector has seen substantial easing of
drought conditions, leading to higher yields, corresponding lower crop and cattle prices and
higher land values. However, the sector has been restrained by lower farm income levels in
2013, as well as higher interest rates on farmland real-estate. The energy sector remains sound,
but off from highs of the previous two years. Most sectors reported higher input prices, but final
goods prices and wages have remained stable, which is consistent with national trends.
2.2.1 Oklahoma Employment
Oklahoma’s employment has risen back above pre-recession levels and overall employment
growth continues to outpace the nation in most areas of the state. Employment growth in the
Natural Resources and Mining sector is expected to remain at historic levels in the next few
years, although at a more moderated pace when compared to the two previous years. Any
significant deviation in energy prices will greatly affect employment in this sector. Employment
in both Manufacturing and Construction is forecast to continue growing over the next two years.
State and Local Government employment is forecast to rise slightly as the state budget continues
to recover, but this is highly dependent on the political process. Federal Government
Page 6

Feb-17-2017 008108

Economic Outlook

2013 Load Forecast

employment in the state is anticipated to continue declining due to spending cuts at the federal
level.
2.2.2 Oklahoma Energy Sector
Overall energy activity remains fairly stable at high levels in Oklahoma. Oklahoma drilling
activity has slipped somewhat as growth in the number of active crude oil rigs offset steep
declines in natural gas drilling. Drilling activity is expected to grow at a consistent pace in
coming months, even as activity continues to shift away from natural gas to oil. A slowdown in
natural gas drilling is expected to put upward pressure on natural gas prices. Crude oil prices
have been influenced by the conflicting pressures of declines in U.S. crude oil inventory and
concerns over softening global demand. However, later this year, China is projected to exceed
the US in oil imports, which is expected to ease any remaining global demand concerns.
2.2.3 Manufacturing Sector
Manufacturing production and hiring have continued to increase, but at a more moderated pace
when compared to the previous two years. Manufacturers expect activity in the near term to be
substantially moderated from gains seen in 2011 and 2012. Manufacturing production in the
OG&E service territory is closely related to oil and natural gas drilling activity.
2.2.4 Real Estate and Construction
Real estate activity continues to improve, and construction activity has strengthened. Residential
home sales and prices have risen, and home inventories continue to fall. The housing market is
expected to continue to improve in the near term, with storm recovery construction expected to
provide further positive influence in the sector. Even before the May 2013 storm/tornado
impact, which the Oklahoma Department of Insurance estimates could top $1 billion; builders
were reporting an increase in housing starts and a rise in new home prices as well as
improvement in the traffic of potential buyers. Commercial real estate conditions have
moderated. Construction and sales of commercial real estate properties have slowed slightly,
real estate prices and rents have remained flat but vacancy rates continue to fall. Views are
mixed on the near-term impact rising interest rates will have on the real estate sector.
2.3

Role of Economic Data in 2013 Energy Sales F orecast

The 2013 retail energy forecast is based on retail sector-level econometric models representing
OG&E’s Oklahoma and Arkansas service territories. Historical and forecast economic variables
(drivers) are provided by the Center for Applied Economic Research at Oklahoma State
University (OSU). The historical economic data is compared to actual retail sales to determine a
correlation. Then the economic forecast parameters are used to predict retail energy based on
historically-defined correlations.
2.4 Economic Drivers for Energy Forecast
The 2013 Economic Forecast calls for modest increases in economic growth in Oklahoma and
ft. Smith over the next five years relative to the previous decade. The economic drivers for Ft.
Smith show higher growth rates over the next five years in comparison to the previous decade
due to relatively poor economic conditions during the previous decade. The growth rates for
Page 7

2019 to 2023 are still expected to remain at strong levels as the prolonged economic recovery
continues nationally. Table 1 shows the historical and projected annual average growth rates of
the primary economic drivers utilized in the retail energy forecast.

•

•

Energy Efficiency (EE) and Demand Response (DR,,) redttee the toad reqttirenzents on
the system.
Historical savings fionz prevwtLcly implemented FE programs are already embedded in
the toad forecast.

OG&E Demand Side Management includes both Energy Efficiency and Demand Response
programs. While EE programs do provide some demand reduction, EE is designed to educate
and encourage customers to make behavioral changes and purchasing decisions that will provide
long-term benefits in managing their energy usage. DR programs are designed to encourage
customers to reduce their demand during system peak. Detailed descriptions of current programs
can be found in Appendix B Expected DSM Program Impacts.
—

The impact of EE programs implemented between 2009 and 2011 is embedded in the baseline
energy and peak demand forecasts. However, the expected impacts of more recent and future
programs, as well as the expected impact of DR programs have been subtracted from the baseline
forecast to calculate the final energy and peak demand forecasts. Table 2 and Table 3 show the
expected impacts of these programs.

4.1 Econometric Modeling Process Energy
-

The retail energy forecast is generated from a regression analysis of historical energy, economic
growth patterns and annual weather. OG&E’s retail energy is divided into six market segments
(residential, commercial, industrial, petroleum, street lighting and public authority) for both
states (Oklahoma and Arkansas). Within each segment, a variety of different models is prepared
and tested against actual historical sales to determine which model provides the highest quality
forecast for that market segment. The models test a range of variable combinations (i.e. model
specifications), each with separate intercept and slope coefficients.
The dependent variable is OG&E’s retail energy sales by market segment. Key independent
variables include:
•

Electricity price paid by the customer.

•

Economic conditions as reflected through various economic indicators.

•

Cooling degree days, base 65. This cooling degree day variable effectively represents
temperature impacts when daily average temperatures (average of the daily minimum and
daily maximum temperatures) exceed 65 degrees.

•

Heating degree days, base 65. This heating degree day variable effectively represents
temperature impacts when daily average temperatures fall below 65 degrees.

•

Monthly or seasonal variables, used to capture the highly seasonal nature of energy sales.

The monthly energy consumption analysis for each market segment follows a three-step process:
Step 1.

Set up models for each market segment with different variable groups and generate
estimates using the 2012 model specifications as a starting point

Step 2.

Inspect goodness-of-fit and other important statistics (e.g., R-squared, t-statistics,
multicollinearity statistics); compare actual versus predicted values of the
dependent variable over the historical period.

Step 3.

Adjust variables repeat steps 1 and 2 as needed until a final model specification is
generated.

Between 10 and 50 models were estimated for each segment. The final model was not always the
one with the “best fit.” The overriding selection criterion was the model providing the best
forecast. F or example, if a model with an R-square of 0.95 had a larger error in the out-of-sample
Page 10

period than an alternative model with an R-square of 0.93, the later model was selected. Table 4
and Table 5 detail the final model variables used for Oklahoma and Arkansas, respectively.

2013 Energy Forecast Adjustments

The regression analysis cannot predict external changes that will occur in the future. Therefore,
adjustments must be made to the model before the final forecast is generated.
4.2.1 National Energy Efficiency Adjustment
The residential and commercial sectors for Oklahoma and Arkansas were adjusted for energy
efficiency that is expected as a result of the anticipated implementation of national energy
efficiency standards for appliances, lighting products and equipment. The adjustments were
made by utilizing state-level energy efficiency impact data from the “Appliance Standards
Page 11

Feb-17-2017 008113

Energy forecast

2013 Load Forecast

Awareness Project”1 and applying a ratio based on the relationship of OG&E’s service territory
to the state. Existing codes and standards are assumed to be included in the baseline forecast.
The energy efficiency adjustments include standards expected to be implemented in the future.
The results of these calculations are shown in Table 6.

similar to what was used for the retail energy forecast models; OG&E produced separate
forecasts of wholesale sales for all of the wholesale contracts. Out of model adjustments were
then made to those forecasts to reflect current expiration dates.

4.3 Retail Energy forecast and Load Responsibility
Table 7 summarizes the 2013 retail energy forecast (excluding line losses) by state and for the
company as a whole before OG&E DSM program reductions. Weather-normalized annual retail
sales are expected to grow from 26,761 GWh in 2013 to 29,920 GWh in 2023, which translates
into an 11.8% increase over OG&E’s planning horizon, or an average annual increase of 1.12%.

2013 Load Forecast

Energy Forecast

Projected growth rates associated with these data are comparable to those observed over the last
decade. Weather-normalized sales grew by approximately 1.3% annually from 2002 through
2012. Average annual growth is projected to be similar from 2013 to 2018 (1.39%), Average
annual sales growth in the last half of the forecast, the 2019—2023 period, will be lower (0.86%).
This is consistent with economic growth rates noted in the Economic Outlook section of this
report. The retail energy growth rates by state and sector and shown in Table 8 below.

Energy Forecast

4.4 Energy Forecast Uncertainty
Weather uncertainty in the energy models is represented through a Monte Carlo modeling
approach where the last three decades of weather are systematically entered into the various
energy models to produce a distribution of possible sales outcomes.

The weather-year Monte Carlo approach essentially runs all weather years from 1981 to 2012
through the weather-sensitive energy models and the peak demand model to develop a
probability distribution of possible outcomes. Figure 2 shows the results directly from this
modeling process for energy sales and includes FERC adjustments.

The 1 out of 2 years average weather line indicates there is a 50% probability that energy sales
will reach this level or higher.

Now, consider the 1 out of 20 years forecast. This line shows energy sales under more extreme
weather events occurring just 5% of the time. Finally, the lower bound forecast (19 out of 20
year case) shows sales may fall below the normal weather forecast by approximately 900,000
MWh if weather is milder than normal given expected economic performance.

5.1 Econometric Modeling Process

-

Peak Demand

The econometric modeling framework has been in place at OG&E since 2000. The modeling
structure consists of 24 separate hourly equations, one for each hour of the day, with separate
intercept and slope coefficients in the various models. The hourly equations are estimated over
the May through September period.

The dependent variable is OG&E’s normalized load responsibility, less the fixed 25 MW
Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA) Power Sales Agreement (PSA) load, and
includes line losses. Key independent variables include:

•

Cooling degree hours, base 72. This cooling degree hour variable is calculated in a
manner similar to cooling degree days and effectively represents temperature impacts
when temperatures exceed 72 degrees.

•

A second temperature variable, defined as temperature—103°, which addresses the
“topping off’ effect in which there is a reduction in the rate of load increases at very high
temperatures.

•

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) misery index reflecting the
combined effects of humidity and warm temperatures. The misery build-up or duration of
the misery index is captured through the weighted average of past hourly values of the
misery index.1

•

Wind speed.

•

Economic growth as reflected through weather-adjusted retail energy sales, which
represents the aggregate impact of economic conditions on the OG&E system. The sales
are also normalized by the number of days in each month.

The lag structure is designed to pick up the effects of a heat wave lasting a few days or more. More electricity is
demanded later (vs. earlier) in a heat wave, even when temperatures decline slightly. The implication is that “design
temperature” is not sufficient for peak forecasting purposes. The temperature of the building is the result of the
accumulated outdoor temperatures, less the impact of the HVAC system. The weighted average is capable of
capturing the effects of both duration and nighttime cooling since high daytime temperatures and lower nighttime
temperatures are reflected in the average.

population)

The peak demand forecast is generated via a probabilistic approach by using the last 32 available
years of actual weather data. This Monte Carlo modeling approach runs all weather years from
1981 to 2012 through the peak demand model, while alternating the weather year “starting day”
seven times for each day of the week. Since loads are much lower on weekends, alternating the
starting day allows the model to determine the demand impact of actual weather events as if they
had occurred on any day of the week.

This results in a matrix of 32 weather years by seven days, or a total of 224 simulations given the
historical hourly weather data available to OG&E. The peak demand forecast is constructed by
calculating a range of weather-feasible load forecasts for each year over the forecast horizon
from the regression model results. As described above, this step generates 224 weather-feasible
forecasts. These 224 annual load forecasts were ranked from highest to lowest and assigned
probabilities to the occurrence of each forecast under the assumption of a uniform distribution
(i.e., each weather has an equal chance of occurrence).

All of the highest values (peaks) in the resulting forecast distribution occur between 3:00 p.m.
and 7:00 p.m. (Central Daylight Time), with the majority occurring at 5:00 p.m.

5.2

Peak Demand Forecast Adjustments and Load Responsibility

FERC wholesale load adjustments are conducted in two steps based on known and verifiable
events. First, the OMPA wholesale load Power Sales Agreement (PSA) contract is added to the
normalized load responsibility forecast from the model. Second, expiring contracts are subtracted
to obtain final Load Responsibility forecasts. Table 11 reflects the 2013 Load Responsibility
forecast after planned OG&E DSM Programs.

Table 12 illustrates mapping between event (peak demand) occurrence and the occurrence

probability. The median load projections come from the
means that half of the time the peak load would be expected to exceed this level and half of the
time the peak load would be below this level.

Table 13 and Figure 3 summarize the peak load model forecasts with a 97% confidence interval
around potential weather events, assuming no changes in the expected economic outlook. These
estimates include wholesale loads and the assumption of expiring wholesale contracts.
Following the probability assignments in Table 12, the interpretation of these results is as
follows. The 1 out of 2 years or “expected” forecast shows the peak demand level given the 50th
percentile of the load forecast distribution, using all available historical weather data. In this
case, there is a 50% probability the peak load will reach this load level or higher.

2013 Load Forecast

The 1 out of 10 years forecast, which is approximately 200 MW higher than the] out of 2 years
case, shows the estimated peak demand under a more extreme weather event that occurs just
10% of the time. Put differently, over a 10-year planning horizon, it is likely that OG&E will
reach a summer peak consistent with the 1 out of 10 years forecast at least once.

Weather conditions will vary markedly from one year to the next. Consequently, the weather
impact on peak demand will also vary considerably from year to year. Dramatic weather
condition changes have much more impact on year-to-year differences in demand than do
economic growth. Overall, the 97% confidence interval associated with weather conditions
represents a significant source of risk responsible for approximately 640 MW of potential peak
load variability in 2023.

The forecasted total number of retc,il customers in 2023 is 894,805
The retail customer forecast is generated from a regression analysis of historical customer
growth and economic growth patterns. Approximately five to ten models were estimated for
each segment, with 2012 data held as an “out-of-sample” forecasting test period. During the
initial model specification phase, attempts were made at specifying models with a variety of
different economic drivers. Table 14 illustrates the final model variables used for the Oklahoma

Data Sources

OG&E’s service territory encompasses approximately half of Oklahoma and a small area in
western Arkansas, including and surrounding Ft. Smith. Historical data sources used to estimate
the econometric equations and prepare the 2013 forecast fall into the following categories:
•
•
•
•
•

OG&E company data (energy sales, revenue, load responsibility peak demand and
weather-normal degree days);
Constructed variables for the models (usually binary variables);
Weather information;
Economic and demographic data from the Center for Applied Economic Research at
Oklahoma State University; and
Energy Efficiency impacts based on expected national standards for appliances and
equipment from the Appliance Standard Awareness Project (ASAP).

This section describes each of these categories and the types of variables used in the econometric
models.

Internal Information
Sales, Revenue and Customers

OG&E’s Accounting Department provides sales (MWh), revenue, and customer data by revenue
class. This information is recorded in the monthly energy sales report for both Oklahoma and
Arkansas jurisdictions. The monthly energy sales report (by state) contains information from the
1970s to the present. The six revenue classes are: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Petroleum,
Street Lighting and Public Authority.
Retail Electric Prices

In the econometric models with statistically significant electric price variables, the historical values
of the variables are defined as “average” prices (energy revenues divided by energy sales). The
retail electric prices used in the (forward-looking) forecast include the revised cost of operations
along with riders for various other projects. Overall, the expected increases in retail prices are
similar to those in the 2012 forecast. The cumulative increase in price over ten years in the 2013
forecast is 17%. Annually, this breaks down to approximately a 1 .5% increase in the average
price per kWh.
Load Responsibility

The peak load forecasts are obtained based on historical “Nornialized Load Responsibility” data
(defined as the System Load minus OMPA Total Load plus OMPA PSA1 plus Load Curtailment
plus real-time pricing (RTP) induced self-generation). The normalized load responsibility series
was further adjusted for peak demand modeling purposes by subtracting variable OMPA PSA
loads and forecasting these directly as wholesale FERC loads.
2

OMPA PSA contract terminates 12/31/2013 and is removed from forecast at that time due to the absence of an
Evergreen clause in the contract.

Appendix

2013 Load Forecast
Weather Normalized Cooling Degree Days and Heating Degree Days

OG&E’s Pricing Department provides the weather-normal monthly Cooling Degree Days and
Heating Degree Days (see definitions below), which are factors in developing the energy forecast
for future years. The weather-normalized CDD and HDD values are based on 30 rolling years of
weather history from selected weather stations in the OG&E service territory.

Information Obtained from External Sources
Weather Data
OG&E obtained the following information from the Department of Commerce, NOAA:
•

Cooling-degree days (CDD).

•

Heating-degree days (HDD).

•

A variety of hourly weather indicators, including temperature, humidity, dew point,
precipitation, wind speed, and cloud cover.

NOAA’s definition of HDD is 65° minus the average of the high and low temperatures of the day
(or zero if the average of the high and low temperatures is greater than 65°). The definition of CDD
is the average of the high and low temperatures of the day minus 65° (or zero if the average of the
high and low temperatures of the day is less than 65°). HDD and CDD for ft. Smith and Oklahoma
City have been used in weather-sensitive sales forecasting equations. Hourly weather data from
these stations, and from Guthrie, Stillwater, and Muskogee, were used to model and forecast peak
loads.
Economic and Demographic Data
OG&E purchases economic and demographic data from Oklahoma State University. The data
include historical and forecasted time series used in the econometric models; these data include
population, real income, wages and salaries, price deflators, various production and output series,
including industrial production, gross state product, natural gas prices, and employment.
In 2007 the Oklahoma economic driver series were adjusted for structural changes in the state’s
economy. OSU’s research had revealed a “billionaire” effect that inflates the real income and
gross state product series that are critically important in forecasting OG&E’s energy sales.
The table below compares the growth rates of 2013 and 2012 forecast drivers. The “ex-energy”
variables, where the “billionaire” effect is removed, are compared to their unadjusted
counterparts. The comparison reveals that the difference in growth rates between the ex-energy
series and their counterpart is still a significant factor, and is in fact increasing for several of the
series compared to the forecasts from 2012.

National Energy Efficiency Codes and Standards Impact Data

The Appliance Standard Awareness Project (ASAP) compiles energy efficiency information about
expected appliance and equipment codes and standards, including expected implementation dates
and expected energy efficiency impacts. OG&E downloaded state-level data from the ASAP
website, http://www.appliance-standards.orgl, and scaled the expected state-level impacts for the
OG&E service territory. The scaled energy efficiency impacts have been included in the baseline
retail energy forecast.

Expected DSM Program Impacts

Demand Side Management (DSM) is designed to reduce the load requirements on the system.
OG&E utilizes two different areas to achieve load reduction. These areas are Energy Efficiency
(EE) and Demand Response (DR).

Energy Efficiency Programs
EE programs are designed to educate and encourage customers to make behavioral changes and
purchasing decisions that will provide long term benefits in managing their energy usage.
Inducements currently are provided through a portfolio of demand programs that encourage
customers to make thermal and equipment upgrades.

Historical Energy Efficiency Programs
Over the past 30 years, OG&E has successfully managed several DSM programs such as:
Positive Energy Home, Geothermal Home, Heat Pumps, Rate Tamer and Power Factor
Correction. The demand reduction and kWh reduction have been captured in the econometric
load forecast models and therefore are embedded in OG&E’s annual load forecast.

Recent EE Programs in Arkansas expanded the work that began with the Quick Start Program as
described in Docket No. 07-075-TF. In Order No. 25 in Docket No. 07-075-Tf, the Arkansas
Public Service Commission ordered OG&E to submit for approval a revised Comprehensive
Plan for Energy Efficiency, (CPEE) to reduce their kWh sales by 0.25% in 2011, 0.50% in 2012;
and 0.75% in 2013 incremental over the baseline year of 2010 that was weather normalized. On
September 30, 2011, OG&E proposed a revised CPEE that was accepted by the Arkansas
Commission on December 30, 2011. These programs are embedding in OG&Es annual load
forecast.

Current and Future Oklahoma Energy Efficiency Programs
According to OAC 165:35-41-4(a), utilities are required to propose, at least once every three
years, a demand portfolio of EE and DR Programs. Working with Frontier Associates LLC.
OG&E chooses programs based upon customer benefit, market potential and budget criteria.
OG&E estimates similar programs will also be effective in future EE filings. Below is a
summary of the current1 and future filings.
a. Weatherization Residential Assistance
This program is designed to provide assistance to both lower and fixed income customers by
engaging licensed contractors to make improvements to the thermal envelope and to inspect and
Cause No. PUD 200900200 and PUB 201200134

tune up mechanical equipment in their homes. This work allows customers to better manage
energy usage, improve their comfort and makes the living space safer.
b. Commercial Lighting
Commercial Lighting will be expanded to include inducements focused on lighting controls and
light emitting diode (LED) lamps as well as repLacement of total lighting systems. The
inducements offered for replacement of inefficient fluorescent lamps will continue.
c. Home Energy Efficiency
This consists of a comprehensive home energy survey targeted to residential customers who need
assistance in identifying areas to improve in both thermal and technology efficiencies.
Assistance is offered for air conditioning tune ups, duct repair and inducements offered for
additional attic insulation installed.
d. Positive Energy-New Home Construction
This program encourages builders and homeowners to utilize energy efficient Positive EnergyNew Home Construction practices by installing higher level than required thermal packages in
the construction of new homes. Builders will be paid inducements to bring new homes to the
higher standards. These homes will be rated and certified by OG&E. This certification allows
homebuilders to apply for available tax credits as a result of these upgrades.
e. Geothermal Heating. Cooling & Water Heating
This program provides inducements to customers who choose to install geothermal heat pumps
into their new or existing homes.
f

Commercial Energy Efficiency

This program is targeted to medium and large commercial customers for the purpose of allowing
them to pursue EE projects unique to their business. Inducements will be paid for kW reduced
by these customers.
g.

Education

This program provides consistent energy information to all levels of customers including
elementary and secondary students with custom presentations at the Energy Technology Center.
OG&E will provide energy surveys to commercial customers targeting churches, non-profits and
schools to provide them with knowledge on quick, low or no cost options to reduce their electric
bills.
h. Industrial Energy Efficiency
This program offers financial inducements for the installation of a wide range of measures but is
primarily targeted to industrial processes that reduce customer energy costs, for the Power and
Light rate or Large Power and Light rate customers

Demand Response Programs
DR programs are designed to encourage customers to reduce their load during peak loading
periods. OG&E has used Real Time Pricing in the past which provides hourly prices for the next
day to allow customers the ability to shift their energy usage. The seasonally and timedifferentiated Time-of-Use (TOU) program communicates varying prices to customers signaling
them to shift their energy use habits. OG&E has recently added more DR programs. These
programs include the technology-enabled DR program (SmartHours), the Integrated Volt Var
Control Program (IVVC) and the Load Reduction Rider.
a. SmartHours
The SmartHours program integrates technology and pricing to help customers reduce energy
usage at peak times. The program utilizes the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) to
securely send price signals across the network and through the smart meter, directly to the
Programmable Communicating Thermostat (PCT). Signals are also sent via text message and
email. Customers respond to these price signals between the weekday hours of 2:00 p.m. and
7:00 p.m. over the four summer months of June, July, August and September and help reduce the
peak demand on the system. By the year 2020, the Company’s goal is to enroll and maintain
approximately 20% of residential customers into the SmartHours program. OG&E estimates this
will eventually provide approximately 160 MW’s of system coincident peak demand reduction.
Likewise, commercial and industrial customers will be able to take advantage of more price
response programs in the future with an estimated peak demand reduction of 74 MW over the
next 10 years.

Appendix

2013 Load Forecast
b. IVVC

The IVVC Program is a system of devices, controls, software and communication products used
to manage OG&Es distribution system reactive power flow and voltage level. This technology
is used to minimize losses and reduce energy demand during peak periods, while ensuring
acceptable customer voltage levels. During non-peak periods, Volt Var Optimization (VVO)
will normally operate in loss reduction mode. In loss reduction mode VVO compensates for
inefficiencies caused by reactive loads such as electric motors. As a result, energy loss reductions
(i.e. energy savings) are expected to be realized during non-peak periods. VVO will be placed in
demand reduction or combined loss/demand reduction mode when needed to help reduce system
peak energy demand. Demand reduction mode reduces voltage in order to achieve a
corresponding reduction in peak energy consumption. Based on study results achieved to date, a
peak demand reduction of approximately 2% has been achieved across the circuits on which this
technology has been deployed. Over the next 10 years, IVVC is expected to reduce OG&E’s
load requirement by 82 MW.
c. Load Reduction Rider
In Cause No. PUD 200800398, OG&E restructured the event based programs to offer the Load
Reduction Rider. This pricing schedule replaced previous event based tariffs while lowering the
customers’ annual on-peak period maximum demand requirement from 500 kW to 200 kW and
above.

Sorry guys, don’t know what happened with that last update I blame
Outlook. The party is at our house, not Robbie’s office. Maybe it was a
good time to send a reminder though to RSVP ©

Hello! This Sunday is the second Sunday of the month, which means it’s
time again for the Test Bar. This month, let’s do it on Saturday night so
we can celebrate Jake turning 30 after the test drinks! Jake will be
making the fan favorites from the past year, including the wildly
illustrious Verbena, so don’t miss out!

Let me know if you’ll be there and if you need help with directions. We
also have room to crash and a live-in DD.
Gifts are definitely not necessary, but if you need an idea feel free to
put a bottle in his hand to celebrate his old age ©

As always, significant others and friends are welcome too. Any other
questions, let me know. Hope you all can make it!
