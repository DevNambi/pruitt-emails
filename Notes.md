### Split emails on the stamped

### Have each email stamped

I'm looking at the documents on the exposed by CMD website and starting with the box identified as "Produce 4000".  For those of you who are not lawyers or legal professionals, the number at the bottom right hand corner of each document (e.g. "004012") is stamped on there for identification purposes when the documents are produced (and it's usually called a bate stamp number).  As you review the documents, if you find something significant you may want to note the bate stamp number so that others can readily find it.
