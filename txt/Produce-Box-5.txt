Saving the GOP 
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
  
Political pundits and activists alike seem astounded by
carpetbagger Terry McAuliffe's victory in Virginia's high-profile
gubernatorial contest. They shouldn't be. Republicans have been put on notice -Feb-17-2017 006217

again.
What played out there was not unlike what converted Colorado from a sold red
state to the not-so-battleground territory Democrats now enjoy. Just as Colorado's
demographics have transformed from an influx of Californians, northern Virginia
has changed the lead of Southern states. In fact, it's a textbook example of how
growing government not only violates Republican ideals, it undercuts the GOP's
future. The progression in northern Virginia is due in no small part to the swelling
federal government, with bureaucrats, activists and consultants beholden to Uncle
Sam. The northern portion of Virginia is blue and growing.

Empowering students   
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
  
 
Last year, an engaged educator at Roosevelt Middle School, a
Title I school in the Oklahoma Public Schools District, asked his students to write a
Feb-17-2017 006223

letter to their congressman. Unfortunately, their response was more apathy than
enthusiasm. Most believed their letters would never be read, meaning their voices
were not important. He wouldn't let that stop them, personally delivering the letters
and arranging for Republican U.S. Rep. James Lankford to visit the school. During
the visit, Lankford referenced the letters, identifying the students by name with their
questions, thereby transforming their impression of what was possible and what
they could achieve by reaching higher than society expects.
 
For Felix Linden, this wasn't enough. To him, they had barely scratched the
surface of their potential. So, he teamed up with fellow teacher Lauren Knobbe and
set out to remake what was possible for children on the south side of Oklahoma
City. Together, they created the Roosevelt Leadership Academy.

"One of America's most durable myths," George Leef writes over at Forbes,
"is that the more people who graduate from college, the more the economy
will grow."
 
For many years, politicians and leaders of the higher education
establishment have advanced that notion. In his first major speech as
president, for example, Barack Obama said that if we want a strong
economy, we need to lead the world in the percentage of the
population that has earned a college degree. And in a recent op-ed in
The Wall Street Journal, two college presidents (Robert Gates of
William and Mary and David Boren of the University of Oklahoma)
argued that decreasing state spending on higher education means that
we are "sacrificing our young people's futures - and our future
economic growth ..."

The abysmal failure of the launch of Obamacare's insurance exchanges has
received much attention. Proponents of Obamacare hope that website
improvements and intense marketing will be able to salvage the effort. But
an even more important discussion awaits once the exchanges are
"operable." Getting health insurance through Obamacare's exchanges,
especially with the assistance of tax credits, poses a great risk to the health

The abysmal failure of the launch of Obamacare's insurance exchanges has
received much attention. Proponents of Obamacare hope that website
improvements and intense marketing will be able to salvage the effort. But
an even more important discussion awaits once the exchanges are
"operable." Getting health insurance through Obamacare's exchanges,
especially with the assistance of tax credits, poses a great risk to the health

“Why the Hobby Lobby Case Matters”
A talk by Dr. Russell Moore
[introduced by Pruitt; Moore talks for 15-20 minutes, followed by Q&A]
Hosted by the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of Oklahoma Baptists
and the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs
Wednesday, February 5, 2014 from 8:00 to 9:00 AM
At OCPA, 1401 N. Lincoln Blvd.
This invitation is non-transferable. Seating is limited.
BIO:
Russell D. Moore is President of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious
Liberty Commission, the Southern Baptist Convention’s official entity
assigned to address social, moral, and ethical concerns. He is the keynote
speaker for the Rose Day event this year at the Oklahoma state capitol.
Dr. Moore earned a B.S. in history and political science from the
University of Southern Mississippi. He also received the M.Div. in biblical
studies from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and the Ph.D. in
systematic theology from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. A
widely-sought cultural commentator, Dr. Moore speaks frequently to
issues
of theology, culture, and public policy, having been quoted or published
by
many of the nation’s leading news agencies and periodicals — including
the
New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune,
USA
Today, and the Associated Press.
He blogs frequently at his “Moore to the Point” website, and is the author
or editor of five books, including Tempted and Tried: Temptation and the
Triumph of Christ, Adopted for Life: The Priority of Adoption for Christian
Families and Churches, and The Kingdom of Christ: The New Evangelical
Perspective. In addition to these, Dr. Moore is also the author of dozens
of academic articles and essays within the field of systematic theology and
Christian ethics. He also serves as Senior Editor of Touchstone: A Journal
of Mere Christianity.
An ordained Southern Baptist minister, Dr. Moore has served as a pastor
for
a number of Southern Baptist churches — most recently serving as
preaching
pastor at Highview Baptist Church from 2008-2012. More broadly, Dr.
Moore
has served his denomination at-large, as chairman and four-time member
of
the SBC Resolutions Committee, and as a regular columnist for Baptist

Prior to entering ministry, Dr. Moore was an aide to U.S. Congressman
Gene
Taylor. A native Mississippian, he and his wife Maria are the parents of
five boys.

BIO:
Russell D. Moore is President of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious
Liberty Commission, the Southern Baptist Convention’s official entity
assigned to address social, moral, and ethical concerns. He is the keynote
speaker for the Rose Day event this year at the Oklahoma state capitol.
Dr. Moore earned a B.S. in history and political science from the
University of Southern Mississippi. He also received the M.Div. in biblical
studies from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and the Ph.D. in
systematic theology from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. A
widely-sought cultural commentator, Dr. Moore speaks frequently to issues
of theology, culture, and public policy, having been quoted or published by
many of the nation’s leading news agencies and periodicals — including the
New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, USA
Today, and the Associated Press.
He blogs frequently at his “Moore to the Point” website, and is the author
or editor of five books, including Tempted and Tried: Temptation and the

Families and Churches, and The Kingdom of Christ: The New Evangelical
Perspective. In addition to these, Dr. Moore is also the author of dozens
of academic articles and essays within the field of systematic theology and
Christian ethics. He also serves as Senior Editor of Touchstone: A Journal
of Mere Christianity.
An ordained Southern Baptist minister, Dr. Moore has served as a pastor for
a number of Southern Baptist churches — most recently serving as preaching
pastor at Highview Baptist Church from 2008-2012. More broadly, Dr. Moore
has served his denomination at-large, as chairman and four-time member of
the SBC Resolutions Committee, and as a regular columnist for Baptist Press

Prior to entering ministry, Dr. Moore was an aide to U.S. Congressman Gene
Taylor. A native Mississippian, he and his wife Maria are the parents of
five boys.

Freedom Flash: Heritage Foundation researchers tout 'a new way to fund education'

Heritage Foundation researchers tout 'a new way to fund

Forward the cause:

  

 

   

 
In a column published last week in The Oklahoman, Lindsey M. Burke and
Brittany Corona of The Heritage Foundation discussed the innovative
Education Savings Account (ESA) program in Arizona, which allows parents
to bank a portion of their child's per-pupil funding and use it to customize an
education for their children.
 
ESAs are the first of their kind, giving parents full control over 90
percent of the funds that would have been spent on their child in their
assigned public school. Once parents choose to withdraw a child from
the public system, funds are deposited onto a restricted-use debit card;
the parents are then able to direct spending to any education-related
service or provider of choice.

assigned public school. Once parents choose to withdraw a child from
the public system, funds are deposited onto a restricted-use debit card;
the parents are then able to direct spending to any education-related
service or provider of choice.

In a column published last week in The Oklahoman, Lindsey M. Burke and
Brittany Corona of The Heritage Foundation discussed the innovative
Education Savings Account (ESA) program in Arizona, which allows parents
to bank a portion of their child's per-pupil funding and use it to customize an
education for their children.
 
ESAs are the first of their kind, giving parents full control over 90
percent of the funds that would have been spent on their child in their
assigned public school. Once parents choose to withdraw a child from

Dear Friend,
It's December, which for the majority of us means it's time to decorate the Christmas

Feb-17-2017 006328

issues of theology, culture, and public policy, having been quoted or published by many of the
nation’s leading news agencies and periodicals — including the New York Times, Wall Street
Journal, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, USA Today, and the Associated Press.
He blogs frequently at his “Moore to the Point” website, and is the author or editor of five
books, including Tempted and Tried: Temptation and the Triumph of Christ, Adopted for Life:
The Priority of Adoption for Christian Families and Churches, and The Kingdom of Christ:
The New Evangelical Perspective. In addition to these, Dr. Moore is also the author of dozens
of academic articles and essays within the field of systematic theology and Christian ethics.
He also serves as Senior Editor of Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity.
An ordained Southern Baptist minister, Dr. Moore has served as a pastor for a number of
Southern Baptist churches — most recently serving as preaching pastor at Highview Baptist
Church from 2008-2012. More broadly, Dr. Moore has served his denomination at-large, as
chairman and four-time member of the SBC Resolutions Committee, and as a regular
columnist for Baptist Press.
Prior to entering ministry, Dr. Moore was an aide to U.S. Congressman Gene Taylor. A native
Mississippian, he and his wife Maria are the parents of five boys.

Hello, Katie.
Thank you for the kind words; happy to help General Pruitt and thankful for his tremendous
leadership!
Tomorrow is perfect for me, as I am pretty fluid aside from a 9:00-10:00am appointment.
Unfortunately, I am traveling on Wednesday. What is a good time and location for the AG
tomorrow? I'm cc'ing my colleague Cassandra, should you need assistance on our end with
scheduling details.
Thank you.
Best,
Michael

Would you like to meet with the AG possibly tomorrow or Wednesday? I know starting this weekend he
has a bunch of travel scheduled so I want to make sure we get this on the schedule.

though I don't happen to share that concern, last Sunday in the state's
largest newspaper, The Oklahoman, I offered some suggestions on how to
do just that. For example, school choice - vouchers, tax credits, and
education savings accounts - can incentivize parents to choose nonpublic
schools, thus increasing per-pupil funding in the government's schools.

Freedom Flash: It's a new year, and 'public education' is changing
01/06/2014 08:09 AM

OCPA's daily e-mail delivering policy perspectives each weekday.
 

We're blogging:
Watch the high court, cut

It's a new year, and 'public education' is changing

Obamacare Medicaid

expansion would harm
Oklahoma's economy
Meddling hurts ranchers,
consumers

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
You may have noticed that some Oklahomans are terribly concerned with
this matter of increasing per-pupil spending in the public school system. And
though I don't happen to share that concern, last Sunday in the state's
largest newspaper, The Oklahoman, I offered some suggestions on how to
do just that. For example, school choice - vouchers, tax credits, and
education savings accounts - can incentivize parents to choose nonpublic
schools, thus increasing per-pupil funding in the government's schools.

Free Market Friday: Asking for the moon 
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
  
 
Annually, state agencies are required to file their budget requests
Feb-17-2017 006375

for the upcoming fiscal year. A review of requests reveals that if state agencies
have their way, they might as well ask for policymakers to grant them the moon as
well.
 
Based on a recent inquiry of budget requests submitted to the Office of
Management and Enterprise Services, state agencies are requesting appropriation
increases of more than $878 million. State agencies are also planning on federal
funding increases of more than $277 million. To assist in this total requested
increase of more than $1.1 billion, state agencies are seeking personnel additions
of 2,139 full-time-equivalent employees.

booming ... more people enroll!
 
In the 2000 state budget year, 12.13 percent of Oklahoma's population

Mr. Brake, who has recently authored a centennial history of Putnam City
Schools, says he did encounter some excellent teachers. However, "in
classroom after classroom, in subject after subject, in grade level after grade
level, I encountered dreary, uninspired, boring instruction. Teachers sit at

Hertz recently broke ground on its new corporate headquarters in Estero,
Florida. Not huge news, perhaps. Just another frost belt company heading
for the sun as Hertz abandons its longtime corporate headquarters in New
Jersey. One reason for the move, obviously, is Florida's status as one of
America's top business destinations, thanks to the absence of a personal
income tax there.

Hertz recently broke ground on its new corporate headquarters in Estero,
Florida. Not huge news, perhaps. Just another frost belt company heading
for the sun as Hertz abandons its longtime corporate headquarters in New
Jersey. One reason for the move, obviously, is Florida's status as one of
America's top business destinations, thanks to the absence of a personal
income tax there.

The next step in the battle of ideas
12/12/2013 10:42 AM

Blog     Perspective     Donate 
Dear Friend of Freedom,
Your involvement with the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs through the years has
enabled this organization to consistently produce bold policy ideas for this state we
call home. By emphasizing the free market, limited government, and individual
initiative, OCPA has proven that ideas can make a difference.
 
Feb-17-2017 006454

But the battle of ideas is never over. To quote a former U.S. president we all admire,
"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it
to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for
them to do the same."
 
With these thoughts in mind, I encourage you to learn more about OCPA's new
action partner, OCPA Impact, which launched this month to do just that -- fight for
freedom. As a 501(c)4 nonpartisan organization, OCPA Impact is already engaged in
efforts to produce results on policy issues important to the members and supporters
of OCPA. Guiding this essential organization is one of the freedom movement's
brightest stars, Dave Bond, former Director of External Relations for OCPA. I
encourage you to watch Dave's introductory remarks at www.OcpaImpact.com and
contact him directly at 405-633-3475 or Dave@OcpaImpact.com to become involved,
as I have.
 
All the best,

Michael Carnuccio
President

The next step in the battle of ideas
12/12/2013 10:40 AM

Blog     Perspective     Donate 
Dear Friend of Freedom,
Your involvement with the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs through the years has
enabled this organization to consistently produce bold policy ideas for this state we
call home. By emphasizing the free market, limited government, and individual
initiative, OCPA has proven that ideas can make a difference.
 
Feb-17-2017 006460

But the battle of ideas is never over. To quote a former U.S. president we all admire,
"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it
to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for
them to do the same."
 
With these thoughts in mind, I encourage you to learn more about OCPA's new
action partner, OCPA Impact, which launched this month to do just that -- fight for
freedom. As a 501(c)4 nonpartisan organization, OCPA Impact is already engaged in
efforts to produce results on policy issues important to the members and supporters
of OCPA. Guiding this essential organization is one of the freedom movement's
brightest stars, Dave Bond, former Director of External Relations for OCPA. I
encourage you to watch Dave's introductory remarks at www.OcpaImpact.com and
contact him directly at 405-633-3475 or Dave@OcpaImpact.com to become involved,
as I have.
 
All the best,

Michael Carnuccio
President

WE MADE A LIST
WE CHECKED IT TWICE
OF ALL OUR SUPPORTERS WHO HAVE BEEN SO NICE
THE GIFT YOU GAVE IS HERE TO STAY
BECAUSE FREEDOM WILL BE THEIRS ONE DAY
As you make year-end gifts, we humbly ask that you keep OCPA in mind -- not just for
the sake of the immediate work we do, but also because the personal and economic
freedoms we defend on a daily basis preserve liberty for our most precious gifts, our
children and grandchildren.
If you're so inclined, please consider making a tax-deductible contribution. Either way,
our state and country are blessed by your philanthropy (literally "love of people"!) and we
want to say thank you.
"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to
our children in the bloodstream.It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them
to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our
children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free." Ronald Reagan
MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM OUR FAMILY TO YOURS.

Free Market Friday: A merry Christmas 

 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
  
 
Every Christmas, I am reminded of the phone call that still haunts
my yuletide caroling. Late Christmas morning, when I was in the fifth grade, I
Feb-17-2017 006496

received a call from one of my classmates. For our purposes, we'll refer to him as
James. We sat near each other in class, but didn't hang out much outside of
school. The call was unique, but welcomed. After a minute of pleasantries, James
asked me what all I got for Christmas. As any child would, the 11-year-old me
wasted no time detailing the splendor under the tree. Then I asked James about
his bounty. He brushed the question aside with a causal "oh, you know, the same
stuff." He then asked me for another classmate's phone number and we ended the
brief call.

Freedom Flash: Meddling hurts ranchers, consumers
12/19/2013 08:06 AM

OCPA's daily e-mail delivering policy perspectives each weekday.
 

We're blogging:
In the driver's seat ... to
Florida 
Toward a free-market farm
policy

Meddling hurts ranchers, consumers
 
By Brian Bush

 

OCPA distinguished fellow

Feb-17-2017 006506

defends free enterprise
New study 'devastating' for
universal preschool
advocates

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
One of my morning rituals is to grab a cup of coffee and read the Oklahoma
Farm Report from Ron Hays. A recent edition had a very interesting snippet
regarding Senator Tom Coburn and how the Renewable Fuel Standard is
impacting producers in our state. Sen. Coburn, along with Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-CA), recently introduced the Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination
Act of 2013. It once again offers the perspective that the free market does it
better. But don't simply take my word for it.

Producers vs. looters 

 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
  
If you want more of something, incentivize it; if you want less of
something, consequence it.
 
Feb-17-2017 006514

I will forever maintain that income tax is an immoral form of taxation, as it removes
the first sweat from a man's brow. In Oklahoma, the very first 5.25 percent a
person earns - keyword there - is confiscated by the government. Furthermore, the
act is akin to the state telling hard workers that Big Brother knows better how to
spend the fruits of their labor than they do. It's hard to find a more improper system
for securing resources.

freedom, taxes, job creation

Steering clear of the train wreck
 
By Brandon Dutcher

 

Obamacare forces
Oklahoma grandmother to

Feb-17-2017 006524

'Why does Oklahoma still
have a universal prekindergarten program?'

Oklahomans' privateproperty rights

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
 
Despite great pressure from Oklahoma's organized left and from the
hospital-industrial complex (which Avik Roy calls "the most heavily
government-subsidized industry in the history of the world"), Gov. Mary
Fallin has refused to go along with the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. As
she said a year ago,
 
I have also decided that Oklahoma will not be participating in the
Obama Administration's proposed expansion of Medicaid. Such an
expansion would be unaffordable, costing the state of Oklahoma up to
$475 million between now and 2020, with escalating annual expenses
in subsequent years.

Opinion
ObamaCare's Next Legal Challenge
The law says subsidies can only go through state-run exchanges.
By Scott Pruitt
Dec. 1, 2013 6:38 p.m. ET
Oklahoma City
As millions of Americans see their health-insurance premiums increase, have
their coverage dropped as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and are
unable to use the federal exchange, Oklahoma has sued the Obama
administration. The Sooner State and several others are trying to stop the
government from imposing tax penalties on certain states, businesses and
individuals in defiance of the law. If these legal challenges are
successful, the deficit spending associated with the new health-care law
could be reduced by approximately $700 billion over the next decade.
While the president's health law is vast and extraordinarily complex, it is
in one respect very simple. Subsidies are only to be made available, and
tax penalties for not signing up for health insurance are only to be
assessed, in states that create their own health-care exchange. The IRS,
however, is attempting to enforce tax penalties in all states—including
Oklahoma and the majority of the other states that have declined to create
their own exchanges. Citizens and businesses in these states must use the
federal exchange instead.

<ATT00001.jpg>
Bloomberg News
The distinction is critical, because under the terms of the law it is the
availability of government insurance-premium subsidies that triggers the
penalties against businesses if they fail to provide their employees with
health insurance that the administration deems acceptable. This is a huge
problem for the administration, which desperately needs to hand out tax
credits and subsidies to the citizenry to quash the swelling backlash
against the law.
When Oklahoma first raised this challenge in 2012, many experts predicted
that the Sooner State would "go it alone" in pursuing this legal strategy.
Not so. In Indiana, the state and 15 school districts have filed a lawsuit
against the IRS, the agency that collects the penalties. Business owners
(who, like the state of Oklahoma, would be subject to penalties as
employers) and individuals in Virginia and the District of Columbia have
done the same. In the D.C. lawsuit, the presiding judge recently rejected
the Obama administration's attempt to have the case dismissed, as the judge
in the Oklahoma case did in August.
Motions for summary judgment will soon be filed in federal district courts,

They are not. Congress was exceedingly clear that tax credits and subsidies are available to
people whose plans "were enrolled in through an exchange established by the State under

than citizens who buy their insurance through an exchange established under section 1311

Congress specified that credits and subsidies are only to be available in states that set up
their own health-insurance exchange for a reason: It could not force states to set up
exchanges. Instead, it had to entice them to do so. Oklahoma's lawsuit is about preserving
the state's authority to make a policy decision granted to states under the Affordable Care

Should the courts decide the IRS is exceeding its authority and isn't allowed to assess the
employer penalties in states that have not established their own exchanges, the structure
of the ACA will crumble—as one of the primary mechanisms the federal government has
employed to force people into the health-insurance market evaporates.
As much as we wish the government were run like a business, the administration cannot
"improve" upon legislation passed by Congress by rolling out updates in the manner that
Silicon Valley does. That's not permitted under the Constitution: Congress passes laws, the
president executes them. Period. That's why Oklahoma and other states are fighting to stop

Attorney General Scott Pruitt is protecting the rule of the law
 
By Jonathan Small, CPA

Remembering JFK
'We now have hope'

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
 
In trying to win support for Obamacare, President Barack Obama lied to the
American people at least 36 times. Those lies have impacted
Oklahomans and serve as a lesson why Oklahoma should not adopt any
form of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, accept any Obamacare funds, or
believe any of the other promises of Obamacare's proponents.
 
But even as President Obama continues "fundamentally transforming the
United States of America," Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is
working to preserve the country given to us by America's founders. Pruitt
and his team are keenly aware of the federal government's multiple attempts
to go beyond its authority and to trample the rule of law. Thankfully, Pruitt
has made it a top priority to block and fight this federal overreach.

"For years, Judith and Jacob Suarez prayed to be able to send their four
children to Catholic schools," OCPA research associate Tina Korbe Dzurisin
writes this month in Perspective.
 
As active parishioners at Saint Eugene Catholic Church in Oklahoma
City, they often encountered families whose kids attended private
schools - and they couldn't help but notice the resources available to
those students. Meanwhile, their own children - Kevin, 14, Jacob, 13,
Jocelyn, 11, and Judith, 9 - attended public schools in the Mid-Del
school district. They reported mild bullying, and Jocelyn, in particular,
fell behind academically. As dearly as they desired an alternative, the
couple simply could not afford the cost of Catholic school tuition.

A few weeks ago OCPA research associate Tina Dzurisin appeared on Neil
Cavuto's program on the Fox Business Network to discuss the slow-motion
train wreck that is Obamacare. Last week on Cavuto's program, Oklahoma
Gov. Mary Fallin did the same. Among other things, Gov. Fallin criticized the
rollout of the exchanges, the premium hikes that many Americans are
facing, and the oft-repeated promise that if you like your plan you can keep
your plan. "That has just not proven to be true," she said.

One of the frustrations Americans have with politics is the abuse of
power - at times corruption - that takes place in public office. In poll after poll,
Feb-17-2017 006580

regardless of political affiliation or ideology, citizens trust government at alarmingly
decreasing levels. Earlier this week Oklahomans saw these fears play out publicly. 
 
At the same time that a former state representative was convicted of committing
bribery while in office, a current Oklahoma bureaucrat was using taxpayer
resources to advance an ideologically driven, personal political agenda.
 
Broken Arrow Schools Superintendent Jarod Mendenhall is calling for a vote of no
confidence in state Superintendent Janet Barresi. He's also touting a new series of
articles on Broken Arrow's website, "Pass or Fail? A Comprehensive Look at Our
Students' Educational Future." To promote the articles, the district even printed
and mailed 40,000 fliers to Broken Arrow patrons.

power - at times corruption - that takes place in public office. In poll after poll,

At the same time that a former state representative was convicted of committing
bribery while in office, a current Oklahoma bureaucrat was using taxpayer
resources to advance an ideologically driven, personal political agenda.
 
Broken Arrow Schools Superintendent Jarod Mendenhall is calling for a vote of no
confidence in state Superintendent Janet Barresi. He's also touting a new series of
articles on Broken Arrow's website, "Pass or Fail? A Comprehensive Look at Our
Students' Educational Future." To promote the articles, the district even printed
and mailed 40,000 fliers to Broken Arrow patrons.

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
 
Despite spending more money on public education than many other
developed countries, America's student-performance woes persist - in part
because public schools often have no motivation to improve. But the
increasing availability of educational options - charter schools, virtual
schools, magnet schools, vouchers, homeschooling, and more - represents
a positive development for students and for public schools themselves.
Indeed, far from undermining public education, school choice provides an
environment in which public schools can thrive.
 
That's the message of a recent article written either by (a) an OCPA
researcher, or (b) an education professor at Langston University - a loyal
Democrat who believes that "Barack Obama is one of the greatest
presidents America has ever seen."

"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other
things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal
Feb-17-2017 006600

will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because
that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
postpone, and one which we intend to win."
 
On Sept. 12, 1962, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy delivered one of the
history's great speeches at Rice University in Houston. Typical of JFK, the speech
was bold and aggressive, challenging us to do more than was thought possible. It's
a textbook display of executive leadership that moved this nation toward the
mantle of history.

JFK Stamp
Steering clear of the train
wreck

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
 
As we recall the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, some of those on the left might be a bit uncomfortable with certain
aspects of JFK's legacy. Any fair examination of that legacy shows that he
was hardly the big-government liberal they prefer to recall. Indeed, as Ira
Stoll argues in his new book JFK, Conservative, Kennedy was devoted
chiefly to anticommunism and to economic growth. 
 
Kennedy was a stern anti-communist. And the most memorable phrase from
his inaugural address - "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what
you can do for your country" - could have served as a theme for
conservative welfare-reform policies of the 1990s. But he is best
remembered among advocates of smaller, leaner government for his 1963
proposal to cut individual and corporate income taxes - "the most important
step we could take to prevent a recession" he called it in the video posted
below, a "creative tax cut" that was specifically designed to increase
economic growth and create jobs.

Dear Friend,
By now I'm sure you have grown tired of reading about the latest crisis in health care.
But headlines such as, "If Oklahoma wins lawsuit, 'the whole structure' of Obamacare
'starts to fall apart,' highlight the significant role Oklahoma plays in providing a lifeline to
millions of Americans. As Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt once said, "I see
OCPA at the forefront of continuing to put into the marketplace ideas that will help the
policymakers understand that we can be the leader across the country..."

Feb-17-2017 006614

As Oklahomans continue to be impacted by government overreach, please consider
supporting OCPA today. Every gift made before Dec. 20 will be matched by another
generous contributor in Oklahoma, who like you and me believe freedom is worth the
fight.

Dear Friend,
By now I'm sure you have grown tired of reading about the latest crisis in health care.
But headlines such as, "If Oklahoma wins lawsuit, 'the whole structure' of Obamacare
'starts to fall apart,' highlight the significant role Oklahoma plays in providing a lifeline to
millions of Americans. As Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt once said, "I see
OCPA at the forefront of continuing to put into the marketplace ideas that will help the
policymakers understand that we can be the leader across the country..."

Freedom Flash: New study 'devastating' for universal preschool advocates
12/09/2013 08:07 AM

to fund education'

New study 'devastating' for universal preschool advocates
 
By Brandon Dutcher

 

Feb-17-2017 006637

Attorney General Scott
Pruitt is protecting the rule
of law
Family thankful for schoolchoice scholarship

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
 
In his State of the Union address this year, President Barack Obama
praised Oklahoma for making it "a priority to educate our youngest children."
The president's comments were not surprising: Oklahoma has a reputation
for leading the nation in early-childhood education. One prominent
Oklahoman, a key Obama fundraiser, has actually visited the White House
at least 16 times to discuss early-childhood education, and has appeared on
a platform with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to promote the cause.
 
But as I said at the time ("President Obama's enthusiasm for Oklahoma
preschool not universally shared"), Mr. Obama's praise of Oklahoma's
preschool program was not warranted. And now comes more bad news for
preschool advocates.

Free Market Friday: Make families matter 

 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
  
 
Over the past year, I've been part of the launch of a national,
nonprofit organization. I spend part of every trip looking through pictures and
Feb-17-2017 006642

videos of my family on my phone. It's that subtle reminder of why I do what I do.
My family inspires me to achieve goals beyond my capabilities while reinforcing the
importance of what I have committed to professionally.
 
This is why I am dedicated to free enterprise and the fight for liberty. My family, as
well as yours, deserves better than the status quo. Our children should not be
shackled by the suffocating debt our selfish government continues to destroy their
future with.

My family inspires me to achieve goals beyond my capabilities while reinforcing the

This is why I am dedicated to free enterprise and the fight for liberty. My family, as

When Oklahoma City physician Keith Smith appeared on Bill O'Reilly's
program Monday night on Fox News, it was just the latest instance of what's
becoming a common occurrence. As Patrick McGuigan reports ("Dr. Smith
goes to Washington: Oklahoma doctor gains national prominence
supporting free market"), "Smith has become a 'go-to' guy for analysts,
regardless of philosophy, who want a thoughtful market-oriented critique of
the current and emerging state of American health-care delivery."
 
Smith founded the Surgery Center of Oklahoma, which has garnered
rave reviews and sympathetic news stories in the regional and national
news media, including in Oklahoma's largest newspaper. He now
regularly testifies before Congress.

Consider that it is vying to unseat Harry Reid's do-nothing leadership and
recapture complete control of the legislative branch; however, the party has yet to

battleground state of Ohio than had backed U.S. Sen. John McCain in that state
four years earlier.

Has the Oklahoma Supreme Court sworn off its addiction to policymaking?
That's the question Andrew Spiropoulos, OCPA's Milton Friedman

Has the Oklahoma Supreme Court sworn off its addiction to policymaking?
That's the question Andrew Spiropoulos, OCPA's Milton Friedman
Distinguished Fellow, asked in a recent Journal Record column. The court's
rejection of a constitutional challenge to the new workers' compensation
reform law gives Professor Spiropoulos reason for optimism.

Dear Friend,
I hope you will consider making an end-of-year contribution to OCPA.
You can see our work through the years here, and we've already started working on
behalf of Oklahomans for the upcoming year.
I'm asking you to join us now as we continue our fight against government intrusion like
the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, and empower Oklahoma families with lower taxes
and  more school choice.
OCPA launched seven freedom centers from health care to agricultural, so please know
you have a partner in OCPA who, like you, believes in free-market principles.
With only a few days remaining in 2013, please consider making a tax-deductible
contribution. Thank you for your support! I look forward to updating you on our progress
through the year.
Happy New Year!

Brandon Dutcher
Senior Vice President
PS: Every gift made through midnight Dec. 31 will be matched up to $20,000 by
another generous contributor in Oklahoma. Visit joinocpa.org to donate today.

Free Market Friday: The night after Christmas

'Twas the night after Christmas, and all giving had maxed. No
investors were moving, they're afraid to get taxed!
Feb-17-2017 006697

 
Detailed plans had been made, for a tough twenty-fourteen; with a sad
understanding, Obamacare will crush all dreams.
 
Politicians with promises, election strategies all mapped; but the state Equalization
Board, said the revenue had napped.
 
When on the front porch step, arose such a clatter, a candidate with push cards,
here to cure all that mattered.

Hi Sarah,
General Pruitt asked that I share his DC dates with you in hopes to set up a meeting. He will only be there
1 day in November and that is on Friday the 15th. If you are available this day we will definitely try to get
something worked out. If we need to look at other dates later on we can do that as well.
Thank you,

Hi Sarah,
General Pruitt asked that I share his DC dates with you in hopes to set up a meeting. He
will only be there 1 day in November and that is on Friday the 15th. If you are available this
day we will definitely try to get something worked out. If we need to look at other dates later
on we can do that as well.

will only be there 1 day in November and that is on Friday the 15th. If you are available this
day we will definitely try to get something worked out. If we need to look at other dates later
on we can do that as well.
Thank you,
Ashley

Ashley – I don’t recall if we’ve met.  I am a Washington DC attorney and have worked before with General Pruitt. I
saw him last week during his testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  I told him I had been
asked to put a panel together for the upcoming American Legislative Exchange Council meeting in Washington.  The
panel subject is EPA overreach and particularly what it is up to on greenhouse gas performance standards for
existing electric generating units.  Since this is the same subject as his testimony, I asked him whether he or
someone in his office would like to use this as a further platform to deliver his message.  He said he was interested
but that I should contact his office about the schedule.  Randy Eminger at ACCCE told me you would be the right one
to go through.
 
The panel will be between 11:00 and 12:15 on Friday December 6 here in DC.  Either General Pruitt or someone on
staff would be a great addition to the panel.
 
Thx much for considering and please let me know at your earliest convenience.

Peter,
Thank you for the information. Unfortunately, we were unable to move General Pruitts schedule around to
make him available for this event. I also checked with two other people from our office who deal with
these issues and they are both already committed to hearings that day. We greatly appreciate you
thinking of us for this opportunity but will have to pass at this time.

Midland Multi-state effort
12/02/2013 12:05 PM

Tom,
 
I appreciated the opportunity to chat with you during the recent AG meeting in Charleston and had
meant to follow-up sooner.    As I mentioned, Troutman Sanders is working with the Illinois Attorney
General’s office and other members of the Executive Committee in connection with  a multi-state
investigation concerning  our client, Midland Credit Management and its parent company, Encore
Capital Group.  You may recall that I introduced you to Andrew Asch, who serves as Midland’s lead
counsel in connection with this matter.    As you may know, Midland is one of the industry leaders in
the debt buyer/ collection industry.   Midland buys portfolios of accounts from established credit
issuers, such as Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo and partners with individuals as they repay
their obligations and work toward financial recovery.
 
The multi-state effort is designed to permit Midland to address the collective concerns of the state
attorneys general in a comprehensive manner.  It is our hope that a multi-state action will result in
consistency across the states as to how consumers are treated.  We believe this effort is particularly
timely, given the existing NAAG working group that is focused on the debt collection industry.  
 
We are pleased that 39  states are participating in the multistate.  To date those states are as
 follows:
 
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia,
Washington, Wisconsin.
 
This effort is being led by Illinois Assistant Attorney General Jeff Feltman.  His contact information is

Midland Multi-state effort
12/02/2013 12:05 PM

Tom,
 
I appreciated the opportunity to chat with you during the recent AG meeting in Charleston and had
meant to follow-up sooner.    As I mentioned, Troutman Sanders is working with the Illinois Attorney
General’s office and other members of the Executive Committee in connection with  a multi-state
investigation concerning  our client, Midland Credit Management and its parent company, Encore
Capital Group.  You may recall that I introduced you to Andrew Asch, who serves as Midland’s lead
counsel in connection with this matter.    As you may know, Midland is one of the industry leaders in
the debt buyer/ collection industry.   Midland buys portfolios of accounts from established credit
issuers, such as Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo and partners with individuals as they repay
their obligations and work toward financial recovery.
 
The multi-state effort is designed to permit Midland to address the collective concerns of the state
attorneys general in a comprehensive manner.  It is our hope that a multi-state action will result in
consistency across the states as to how consumers are treated.  We believe this effort is particularly
timely, given the existing NAAG working group that is focused on the debt collection industry.  
 
We are pleased that 39  states are participating in the multistate.  To date those states are as
 follows:
 
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia,
Washington, Wisconsin.
 
This effort is being led by Illinois Assistant Attorney General Jeff Feltman.  His contact information is

Ashley – I don’t recall if we’ve met.  I am a Washington DC attorney and have worked before with General Pruitt. I
saw him last week during his testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  I told him I had been
asked to put a panel together for the upcoming American Legislative Exchange Council meeting in Washington.  The
panel subject is EPA overreach and particularly what it is up to on greenhouse gas performance standards for
existing electric generating units.  Since this is the same subject as his testimony, I asked him whether he or
someone in his office would like to use this as a further platform to deliver his message.  He said he was interested
but that I should contact his office about the schedule.  Randy Eminger at ACCCE told me you would be the right one
to go through.
The panel will be between 11:00 and 12:15 on Friday December 6 here in DC.  Either General Pruitt or someone on
staff would be a great addition to the panel.
Thx much for considering and please let me know at your earliest convenience.

INVITATION:  Public Policy Conference on Energy and the Environment, George Mason Law School, Arlington,
Virginia, Monday, April 7, 2014

DRAFT AGENDA -- LEC Public Policy Conference on Energy and the Environment April 7 2014 draft of 2-25-14.pdf
DRAFT AGENDA -- LEC Public Policy Conference on Energy and the Environment April 7 2014 draft of 2-25-14.pdf

Dear Friends,
 
After General Pruitt’s successful January 2013 Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil Fuels in Oklahoma City, the
Mason Law & Economics Center started making plans to launch an Initiative for Energy and the Environment.  Richard Faulk,
formerly of Gardere in Houston, joined us in July to lead this effort.  You may recall that Rick participated in the OKC summit. 
Here’s some more information about the Initiative.  http://www.masonlec.org/programs/initiative-energy-environment
 
Rick and I are putting together the Initiative’s first major event – a Public Policy Conference on “Energy and the Environment: Old
Fuels, New Technologies, and Market Dynamics” to be held at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia on
Monday, April 7.   A draft agenda is attached. 

 

The target audience of this conference is the Washington public policy community plus senior staff from state AG offices. 

 

All attendees from the OKC Summit are welcome to attend.  There is no registration fee, but we do require that you register in
advance.  Please click here to register:
 
http://www.masonlec.org/events/event/164-lec-public-policy-conference-energy-environment-old-fuels-new-technologies-market

 

The Mason Attorneys General Education Program (AGEP) is subsidizing attendance of AGs and their senior staff.  The AGEP
reimburses transportation expenses and provides group meals and lodging.  To date, 44 representatives from AGs offices are
registered.  We are limiting future registration to AGs and senior staff who attended the OKC Summit.  AGs and senior staff must
register by Friday, March 7.  Please contact Colleen Cherico, Program Assistant AGEP, at ccherico@gmu.edu and
703.993.9964, with any questions.

 

If you are able to join us for the conference, you will be invited to a private dinner on Sunday, April 6 for speakers, AGs and their
senior staff, and our friends from the OKC Summit.
 
Press coverage will be substantial.  All sessions will be live webcast and then posted on our website for future viewing.

 

Finally, if you know of folks on the Hill or in government agencies who should be invited, please send us their contact
information.
Feb-17-2017 006912

 
I look forward to seeing in April.
 
Thank you.
 
Best,
 
Henry

Aaron – when is the earliest you can get an article in?  I can lobby for a later
date with the magazine editor.
 
Remember that it is only 1000 -1500 words and can be cut and paste from past
editorials and court filings, language that has already been approved in the
past.  I think the General’s thoughts on this issue are clear enough and very
important for readers!   I am really hoping we can make this work!

John,
Good morning.
I'm sorry to write with bad news, but unfortunately we won't be able to meet your deadlines for submitting
an article on regional haze/visibility. I'm sorry for the problems this may cause for your planning. I wanted
to write as soon as I could with the hopes you can make alternate arrangements.  We have a busy couple
of weeks with legal filings on our Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank lawsuits so we will not have the
time to produce an article on regional haze.
Please accept my apologies again for cancelling.
Thank you,
Aaron

Subject: FW: Opportunity for Article on Visibility/regional haze

Mr. Eubanks  

At the suggestion of colleagues at Oklahoma Gas & Electric, I am writing regarding an
opportunity for a state regulator, perhaps AG Pruitt, to contribute an article on regional haze
for an environmental policy journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (the
professional society of air quality specialists).  Details follow:
 

·

The theme of the May 2014 issue of the journal "EM" is visibility/regional haze.  

 

·
The articles are meant to be relatively short – e.g., 1000-1500 words.   The article could
include a few tables or graphics in addition.  
 

·
We are looking for draft submissions in mid-February.  There would be cursory peerreview and opportunity to substantially revise later.
 

·

There will be a broad variety of opinions and information from these committed

Subject: FW: Opportunity for Article on Visibility/regional haze

Mr. Eubanks  

At the suggestion of colleagues at Oklahoma Gas & Electric, I am writing regarding an
opportunity for a state regulator, perhaps AG Pruitt, to contribute an article on regional haze
for an environmental policy journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (the
professional society of air quality specialists).  Details follow:
 

·            The theme of the May 2014 issue of the journal "EM" is visibility/regional haze.  
 

·            The articles are meant to be relatively short – e.g., 1000-1500 words.   The article could
include a few tables or graphics in addition.  
 

·            We are looking for draft submissions in mid-February.  There would be cursory peerreview and opportunity to substantially revise later.
 

·            There will be a broad variety of opinions and information from these committed
authors:        
 

o   EPA (OAQPS)
o   National Park Service
o   Hunton & Williams – industry attorney
o   Public Service  New Mexico
o   National Parks Conservation Association
 

I will give you a call tomorrow to see if I can clarify any details.

Aaron -  It is fantastic that the General or you and your colleagues will contribute an article. 
 
Below is more information on the publication. A few additional helpful hints follow.  Attached is an article from a previous issue to give
you a feeling for the tone and length.  I am not sure whether we will have pictures for the authors or not.  We would appreciate a draft

DRAFT AGENDA -- LEC Public Policy Conference on Energy and the Environment April 7 2014 draft of 2-25-14.pdf

Dear Friends,
 
After General Pruitt’s successful January 2013 Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil Fuels in Oklahoma City, the
Mason Law & Economics Center started making plans to launch an Initiative for Energy and the Environment.  Richard Faulk,
formerly of Gardere in Houston, joined us in July to lead this effort.  You may recall that Rick participated in the OKC summit. 
Here’s some more information about the Initiative.  http://www.masonlec.org/programs/initiative-energy-environment
 
Rick and I are putting together the Initiative’s first major event – a Public Policy Conference on “Energy and the Environment: Old
Fuels, New Technologies, and Market Dynamics” to be held at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia on
Monday, April 7.   A draft agenda is attached. 

 

The target audience of this conference is the Washington public policy community plus senior staff from state AG offices. 

 

All attendees from the OKC Summit are welcome to attend.  There is no registration fee, but we do require that you register in
advance.  Please click here to register:
 
http://www.masonlec.org/events/event/164-lec-public-policy-conference-energy-environment-old-fuels-new-technologies-market

 

The Mason Attorneys General Education Program (AGEP) is subsidizing attendance of AGs and their senior staff.  The AGEP
reimburses transportation expenses and provides group meals and lodging.  To date, 44 representatives from AGs offices are
registered.  We are limiting future registration to AGs and senior staff who attended the OKC Summit.  AGs and senior staff must
register by Friday, March 7.  Please contact Colleen Cherico, Program Assistant AGEP, at ccherico@gmu.edu and
703.993.9964, with any questions.

 

If you are able to join us for the conference, you will be invited to a private dinner on Sunday, April 6 for speakers, AGs and their
senior staff, and our friends from the OKC Summit.
 
Press coverage will be substantial.  All sessions will be live webcast and then posted on our website for future viewing.

 

Finally, if you know of folks on the Hill or in government agencies who should be invited, please send us their contact
information.

I look forward to seeing in April.
 
Thank you.
 
Best,
 
Henry

DRAFT AGENDA -- LEC Public Policy Conference on Energy and the Environment April 7 2014 draft of 2-25-14.pdf

Dear Friends,
 
After General Pruitt’s successful January 2013 Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil Fuels in Oklahoma City, the
Mason Law & Economics Center started making plans to launch an Initiative for Energy and the Environment.  Richard Faulk,
formerly of Gardere in Houston, joined us in July to lead this effort.  You may recall that Rick participated in the OKC summit. 
Here’s some more information about the Initiative.  http://www.masonlec.org/programs/initiative-energy-environment
 
Rick and I are putting together the Initiative’s first major event – a Public Policy Conference on “Energy and the Environment: Old
Fuels, New Technologies, and Market Dynamics” to be held at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia on
Monday, April 7.   A draft agenda is attached. 

 

The target audience of this conference is the Washington public policy community plus senior staff from state AG offices. 

 

All attendees from the OKC Summit are welcome to attend.  There is no registration fee, but we do require that you register in
advance.  Please click here to register:
 
http://www.masonlec.org/events/event/164-lec-public-policy-conference-energy-environment-old-fuels-new-technologies-market

 

The Mason Attorneys General Education Program (AGEP) is subsidizing attendance of AGs and their senior staff.  The AGEP
reimburses transportation expenses and provides group meals and lodging.  To date, 44 representatives from AGs offices are
registered.  We are limiting future registration to AGs and senior staff who attended the OKC Summit.  AGs and senior staff must
register by Friday, March 7.  Please contact Colleen Cherico, Program Assistant AGEP, at ccherico@gmu.edu and
703.993.9964, with any questions.

 

If you are able to join us for the conference, you will be invited to a private dinner on Sunday, April 6 for speakers, AGs and their
senior staff, and our friends from the OKC Summit.
 
Press coverage will be substantial.  All sessions will be live webcast and then posted on our website for future viewing.

 

Finally, if you know of folks on the Hill or in government agencies who should be invited, please send us their contact
information.

I look forward to seeing in April.
 
Thank you.
 
Best,
 
Henry

RM2014-1ProposedRules(1-14-14) PUD related.doc

Attached is a Word version of the Chapter 5 rules we will discuss Wednesday afternoon at 1:30.  We
are scheduled to meet in Room 105.
 
I will be putting these rules on the white board so we can wordsmith them.  These rules are identical
to those used at the January 14 technical conference, with the exception of the words in yellow
highlighting that I changed as a result of comments made at the tech conference.
 
Please forward these to whomever you think would benefit from having them prior to the 1:30
meeting. 
 
Thank you,

Chapter 5 rules after our tech conference yesterday

RM2014-1ProposedRules(2-13-14)PUD updates 2-20-14.doc

Please look at the attached rules one more time, before I send them to Susan Conrad for
distribution.  The yellow highlighted language reflects changes since our tech conference yesterday. 
I have proofed them, but obviously didn’t do a very good job the last time I proofed them so would
appreciate more eyes on them.
 
Thank you,

RHR SIP approved; FIP withdrawn
02/10/2014 11:03 AM
FINAL FINAL SIP Approval NR.DOC

General Pruitt/Melissa: I tried to reach you both this morning with the news that the
EPA has finally approved the state SIP regarding our compliance plan for the regional
haze rule and the MATS rule.
 
EPA also formally withdrew its federal implementation plan for regional haze.
 
Attached is our news release relating to the EPA’s action today.
 
Scott, I wanted to tell you personally how much I appreciate your efforts to pave the
way for a state solution to meeting the RHR challenge.  Your lawsuit against EPA,
and your encouragement of our efforts to settle this issue in a way that benefits the
state, were instrumental in giving us the time and the opportunity to develop a revised
state plan.  I’m very pleased that the EPA recognized the revised state plan as more
cost-effective and more beneficial to Oklahoma and to our customers than the FIP
would have been.
 
Thanks again for your support.  If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to
give me a call.

It was apparent at the tech conference this afternoon that the energy and telecom industry would benefit from a
group work session regarding the proposed Chapter 5 rules of practice revisions.  Please come join us next
Wednesday, 2/5/14 at 1:30 in Courtroom B.  We will put the rules on the wall and see if some agreed to language
can be developed.  The most current version of the rules can be found here:
http://www.occeweb.com/rules/proprules/CH5PropRules011414.pdf
Please feel free to pass this invitation along to others who might be interested in the proposed changes to the PUD
fee assessment rules, assessment against unregulated entities and discovery rules

Scott, I wanted to tell you personally how much I appreciate your efforts to pave the way for a
state solution to meeting the RHR challenge.  Your lawsuit against EPA, and your
encouragement of our efforts to settle this issue in a way that benefits the state, were
instrumental in giving us the time and the opportunity to develop a revised state plan.  I’m
very pleased that the EPA recognized the revised state plan as more cost-effective and more
beneficial to Oklahoma and to our customers than the FIP would have been.
 
Thanks again for your support.  If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a

For Immediate Release

Judge Grants Oklahoma Attorney General’s Request to
Intervene in Lawsuit between EPA and Environmental
Group
Oklahoma now a part of the settlement proceedings, which could impact consumers
and businesses

OKLAHOMA CITY – A federal judge in Denver granted Oklahoma Attorney General Scott
Feb-17-2017 007288

Pruitt’s request to intervene in the settlement of a lawsuit between the EPA and an
environmental group over emission standards in Oklahoma and other states.
The State of Oklahoma had not been given a chance to intervene in the settlement proceedings
between Wild Earth Guardians and the EPA even though the agreement would have
significant impact on Oklahoma consumers and businesses. The judge’s decision means the
Attorney General now can represent the interests of the state as a settlement is negotiated.
“This is good news for the State of Oklahoma. In many cases, these kinds of ‘sue and settle’
lawsuits on environmental regulations are settled without input from the states and industries
affected by the agreements,” General Pruitt said. “In this case, the lawsuit appears to be
another example of a ‘friendly lawsuit’ between the EPA and an environmental group with the
goal of imposing an anti-fossil fuel agenda. We’re thankful the court granted our request to
intervene so that we can protect the best interests of the citizens and State of Oklahoma.”
Wild Earth Guardians’ lawsuit asks the federal court to order the EPA to take action on
Oklahoma and other states to enforce emission standards for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Wild
Earth Guardians claims Oklahoma and other states have failed to submit state implementation
plans to address air quality standards relating to NO2 emissions. The environmental group is
asking the court to force the EPA declare the states out of compliance and allow the EPA to
implement federal implementation plans.
In January 2011, Oklahoma submitted monitoring data to the EPA that showed all areas of the
state were in compliance with the federal nitrogen dioxide standard. Since 2011, Oklahoma
has been preparing its state implementation plan, which demonstrates how the state will
continue to maintain compliance with the NO2 standard. The Oklahoma plan was made
available for public comment in January.
“The Clean Air Act gives states the primary authority to design and implement plans to deal
with these issues,” General Pruitt said. “For an out-of-state environmental group and the EPA
to use the courts to regulate through litigation is wrong and undermines the rule of law. The
Attorney General’s Office will continue to challenge the EPA and other federal agencies that
seek to impose an agenda or policies beyond what’s provided under the law.”

Freedom Flash: School Choice Week is here, media bias in Oklahoma, and more
01/27/2014 07:02 AM

OCPA's weekly e-mail delivering policy perspectives every Monday

NEWS & NOTES
There isn't a revenue problem in Oklahoma. On the
OCPA blog, Jonathan Small points out that
Feb-17-2017 007309

Oklahoma's total state tax collections are at an alltime high.

 
WHO'S COUNTING?
11
The percentage of enrollees
signing up for insurance under
Obamacare who were
previously uninsured,
according to Aetna CEO Mark
Bertolini.

National School Choice Week is here, and Oklahoma
Gov. Mary Fallin has announced that it is School
Choice Week in Oklahoma. Watch Brandon Dutcher
discuss it here, and read Michael Carnuccio's column
saying it's time for Education Savings Accounts in
Oklahoma.
Andrew Spiropoulos, who serves as the Milton
Friedman Distinguished Fellow at OCPA, reminds us
of the Madisonian understanding that a system will
not long survive if it habitually produces laws that
don't benefit the common good.
Over at the Accuracy in Media blog, Brandon
Dutcher highlights a subtle form of media bias in
Oklahoma.
In Perspective, Jason Bedrick says financial
transparency is needed in Oklahoma's school
system, while Jayson Lusk, OCPA's Samuel Roberts
Noble Distinguished Fellow, examines the claim that
food stamps somehow boost the economy.

Freedom Flash: School Choice Week is here, media bias in Oklahoma, and more
01/27/2014 07:02 AM

OCPA's weekly e-mail delivering policy perspectives every Monday

NEWS & NOTES
There isn't a revenue problem in Oklahoma. On the
OCPA blog, Jonathan Small points out that
Feb-17-2017 007318

Oklahoma's total state tax collections are at an alltime high.

 
WHO'S COUNTING?
11
The percentage of enrollees
signing up for insurance under
Obamacare who were
previously uninsured,
according to Aetna CEO Mark
Bertolini.

National School Choice Week is here, and Oklahoma
Gov. Mary Fallin has announced that it is School
Choice Week in Oklahoma. Watch Brandon Dutcher
discuss it here, and read Michael Carnuccio's column
saying it's time for Education Savings Accounts in
Oklahoma.
Andrew Spiropoulos, who serves as the Milton
Friedman Distinguished Fellow at OCPA, reminds us
of the Madisonian understanding that a system will
not long survive if it habitually produces laws that
don't benefit the common good.
Over at the Accuracy in Media blog, Brandon
Dutcher highlights a subtle form of media bias in
Oklahoma.
In Perspective, Jason Bedrick says financial
transparency is needed in Oklahoma's school
system, while Jayson Lusk, OCPA's Samuel Roberts
Noble Distinguished Fellow, examines the claim that
food stamps somehow boost the economy.

"It's as if the number had
simply been made up out of
thin air."
State Rep. Jason Murphey,
discussing the oft-cited figure
of $160 million allegedly
needed to repair the state
Capitol building. Murphey says
this $160 million figure is
"based on absolutely no sound
logic," and that the real price
tag is "much less."

OCPA's weekly e-mail delivering policy perspectives every Monday

NEWS & NOTES
OCPA research fellow Steve Anderson says the
Kansas City metro area recently gained 9,500 jobs
Feb-17-2017 007324

on the (tax-cutting) Kansas side, while the Missouri
side registered no change.

 
WHO'S COUNTING?
$7.86 billion
Total taxes collected by the
state of Oklahoma in FY-2013,
an all-time high

A new survey released by the Friedman Foundation
and OCPA finds that Oklahomans support school
choice, and OCPA's Milton Friedman Distinguished
Fellow says "the establishment of universal school
choice should be our highest policy priority." OCPA
president Michael Carnuccio discusses some of the
survey results here.
OCPA economist Wendy Warcholik says the popular
"Gross Domestic Product" metric undervalues the
impact of the family.
Oklahoma may become the second state to offer
Education Savings Accounts, and OCPA senior vice
president Brandon Dutcher says this would help
Oklahoma parents save for college. He also talks to
FOX 25 about another popular school choice.
OCPA executive vice president Brian Bush chatted
with University of Missouri economist Peter G. Klein
about entrepreneurship, strategies for revitalizing
rural America, and more. Watch the video here.

QUOTE UNQOUTE
"As far as we're concerned,
we don't have health
insurance."

Researchers from the Heritage Foundation and the
Reason Foundation say the return on investment on
Oklahoma's preschool program is abysmal.

OCPA's weekly e-mail delivering policy perspectives every Monday

NEWS & NOTES
Oklahoma's total tax collections and total spending

Feb-17-2017 007354

are at record highs, and revenue collections are
poised to break yet another record.

 
WHO'S COUNTING? 
49 percent
Employment growth in
Oklahoma school district
administration since 1998,
compared to student growth of
6 percent

Pension reform that OCPA has touted for more than
a decade is finally being discussed, and OCPA
research is cited in this story. Jonathan Small took
OCPA's pension-reform message to the Stillwater
Chamber of Commerce.
OCPA president Michael Carnuccio recalls the day
that Rep. Jeff Hickman, now the Speaker of the
House, was a real lifesaver. Also, Southern Baptist
leader Dr. Russell Moore sits down to talk school
choice with Brandon Dutcher, and The Oklahoman
takes note of OCPA's work on the issue.
OCPA distinguished fellow Andrew Spiropoulos is
highly critical of Oklahoma legislation seeking to gut
the Electoral College: "You would think that the first
principle of any conservative legislator would be to
actually conserve our institutions."
Amid the calls for more government spending on
education, this chart on administrative bloat is an
eye-opener.
In the "You Guest It" section of the OCPA blog, state
Rep. Leslie Osborn says Oklahomans could use
additional tax relief.

QUOTE UNQOUTE
"Our most urgent task is to
end the divisions in our
country, to stop the political
bickering, and to unite our
talents and efforts. Americans
of all persuasions are pleading
with our political leaders to
bring us together. I believe
Senator Obama is sincerely
committed to that effort. He
has made a non-partisan
approach to all issues a top
priority."
University of Oklahoma
president David Boren,
endorsing Barack Obama for
president on April 18, 2008

With the "National Popular Vote" proposal rearing its
head again in Oklahoma, this article from Andrew
Spiropoulos, our Milton Friedman Distinguished
Fellow, reminds us what a bad idea it is.
In this analysis of the negative impact of multigenerational welfare, OCPA economists Scott Moody
and Wendy Warcholik give Oklahoma policymakers
yet another reason to stop expanding the Medicaid
rolls.
Writing in USA Today, the author of an OCPA report
on early learning says universal preschool is not the

Feb-17-2017 007399

weeks, Secretary of Finance and Revenue Preston Doerflinger and state Treasurer
Ken Miller have said through reports that the state's tax collections have never
been higher.
 
Total state tax collections have increased $1.5 billion since the recession. Given
the state's current cash position, it is no surprise that lawmakers are considering a
reasonable measure to lower the state's penalty on work, the personal income tax,
to 4.75 percent starting in 2015, and to further systematically lower it to 4 percent
by 2018. Such an idea expresses belief in and support for taxpayers, as well as an
understanding of economics.

Oklahoma Growth & Opportunity Summit this Saturday
02/13/2014 04:14 PM

We'd like to draw your attention to a special upcoming event, the Oklahoma Growth and Opportunity
Summit, which will be held this Saturday, February 15, on the Lemley Campus of Tulsa Tech . The
theme of the summit is "Making Oklahoma the Place to Prosper," and the program will highlight the
need to increase economic freedom and opportunity for Oklahoma families and job-creators by
adopting a more growth-friendly tax policy and reducing the burden of state government.
OCPA staffers will be playing significant roles in the program:
Jonathan Small, OCPA vice president for policy, will outline the steps to be taken to
turbocharge economic freedom in Oklahoma.
Steve Anderson, OCPA research fellow and former budget director for Gov. Sam Brownback,
Feb-17-2017 007409

will explain how Kansas is now on a path to zero state income tax.
Other panel participants include:
Travis Brown, author of How Money Walks, who will discuss how, across America, capital is
moving from high-tax locations to low-tax locations.
Several of Oklahoma's federal and state officials, including Congressman Jim Bridenstine and
Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who will emphasize the importance of economic freedom in our
state and nation.
The Growth & Opportunity Summit is being hosted by organizations who often partner with us on
various projects: Americans for Prosperity and OCPA Impact, along with the Tulsa 912 Project.
For tickets and to RSVP, please visit www.OKGrowthSummit.com. Individual tickets are only $12, and
include lunch.
For more information, visit www.facebook.com/OKGrowthSummit, call 405.633.3475, or email
info@ocpaimpact.com.
We are proud of the great research and ideas of our staff in seeking a better way for Oklahoma, and
we are honored that the organizations conducting this event show such respect for the work of OCPA
staffers by inviting them to participate in this program. We hope you can be a part of the event as well!

Fw: Guest Blog from Atty. Gen. Pruitt
02/12/2014 04:09 PM

Kelly,
Here's a blog post from AG Pruitt. Please let me know if you need a photo or bio information.  Also, links
to our Twitter and FB profiles are in my email signature if there's an opportunity for you to use those.
Thanks,
AC

When Congress first debated religious liberty in the late 1700s,
representatives expressed concern that the wording of the First Amendment
could lead to the abolishment of religion altogether. James Madison, the
principle author of the Bill of Rights, assured them that the First Amendment
simply meant Congress should not “establish a religion” or in effect endorse
a particular denomination at the expense of others, or “enforce the legal
observation of it by law.” That it represented freedom to believe and freely
exercise our faith unencumbered by government mandate or restraint.
What we see now, though, is a government that respects our freedom to
exercise religion only so long as they agree with it. In the Hobby Lobby
case, the government is enforcing a mandate that causes an employer to
violate their lawful religious beliefs and practices. This goes directly against
the ideals our Founding Fathers set in place to protect Americans from an
overbearing and intrusive government.
Dr. Russell Moore noted in his recent visit to OCPA that religious liberty has
been transformative for our country. It motivates us to achieve and
overcome injustice and was at the heart of the abolitionist and civil rights
movements.
I am proud to join David Green and his family in their fight to protect their
ability to exercise their faith wherever, whenever and however they choose.
The Hobby Lobby case is a reminder that our Constitution ensures religion
is not a silent practice confined to four walls, but an opportunity to live out
our faith in the public square.

Ashley,
 
The Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs was hoping to have Atty. Gen. Pruitt write a guest blog for us about religious
liberty. It only needs to be 250-350 words and we’ll publish it on our blog/social media. If at all possible, we would
love to have the blog post by Tuesday next week.
 
Please let me know if he is interested!
Thank you,

TO:

Oklahoma School Choice Coalition members

FROM:

Brandon Dutcher

As you may know, this week is National School Choice Week, and Gov. Mary
Fallin has issued a proclamation declaring it to be School Choice Week in
Oklahoma, too. In observation of School Choice Week, OCPA is holding a press
conference on Tuesday, January 28, at 1:00 PM in the Blue Room of the state
Feb-17-2017 007423

capitol building to release our annual Oklahoma school-choice survey. This
public-opinion survey, conducted by Braun Research, Inc. and released by the
Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice and OCPA, finds strong support
among Oklahomans for charter schools, vouchers, tax credits, and education
savings accounts.
There are several chairs in the Blue Room, and there's plenty of standing room in
the back, so I urge you to join us at the press conference to show your support for
school choice. Hope to see you there!

At a state Capitol press conference last week, state Reps. Jason
Feb-17-2017 007425

Nelson, R-Oklahoma City, and Tom Newell, R-Seminole, rolled out legislation that
would create an education savings account program in Oklahoma. The time for this
idea has come.
 
In a public-opinion survey to be released on Tuesday by the Friedman Foundation
for Educational Choice (margin of error +/- 4.0 percentage points), registered
Oklahoma voters were asked: "An education savings account -- often called an
ESA -- allows parents to take their child out of a public district or charter school,
and receive a payment into a government-authorized savings account with
restricted but multiple uses. Parents can then use these funds to pay for private
school tuition, virtual education programs, private tutoring, or saving for future
college expenses. In general, do you favor or oppose this kind of savings account
system?"

Hobby Lobby event
02/03/2014 11:01 AM

Good morning,
First, apologies for sending this from my Gmail account. We're having issues with our
office e-mail system this morning.
I wanted to check on the Hobby Lobby event this week and whether 1) it's open to
the media and 2) will you be sending any press releases (pre- or post-event), enewsletter or social media hits.
We'd like to coordinate any press - and could provide a statement from the AG - as
well as make sure we're using the correct handles and hashtags for social media.
Finally, do you have alternate plans in place in case of inclement weather?
Thanks for your time,
Aaron

Join thousands of Oklahomans who want more school choice options

Dear Friend,
Knowing you care about the future of the next generation, I am writing to ask you to help
Oklahoma children like Chloe, whose life changed for the better thanks to a school
choice opportunity.
As a longtime education advocate, an OCPA trustee, and most importantly as a parent, I
consider bettering Oklahoma's education system for all children my top priority. The best
way to do that is by empowering parents to choose the educational method that best fits
their individual child. And Oklahomans agree.
Survey  results released this week show 56% of Oklahomans believe things in
Oklahoma's K-12 education system have generally gotten off on the wrong track. The
majority of Oklahomans say they want more options when it comes to education.
If, like me, you believe that a child's life should not be determined by socioeconomic
status or geography, then please consider giving $56.00 today as part of National
School Choice Week, and support OCPA's work toward expanding school choice
options. Together we can provide a better way for all Oklahoma children to receive the
education they deserve.

Bill Price
OCPA Trustee
P.S. To show your support during National School Choice Week, join us on Facebook
and share Chloe's story.

quick question

Jonathan,
My name is Emily Shipley. I'm the new public policy coordinator for the AG as of October 2013. I do not
believe we have had a chance to meet yet, so I wanted to preface with a quick intro!
I have a quick question for you about an education tech company and event General Pruitt was invited to
next week in Tulsa. Melissa Houston said to drop OCPA a line to see if you all have ever heard of the
company, and I think you were walking out the door as I called.
If you can give me a call at your earliest convenience, I would greatly appreciate it. My cell is 405-2506095.
Thanks.

Sounds great- will send the request over to our communications department. Thank you for the
information.
I was actually going to try and contact someone today to find out when Grover Norquist was coming to
speak for you all. Any chance you would know or could give me some contact information on someone
who would? General Pruitt heard he was coming when he was over there on Wednesday!

Ashley,
 
The Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs was hoping to have Atty. Gen. Pruitt write a guest blog for us about religious
liberty. It only needs to be 250-350 words and we’ll publish it on our blog/social media. If at all possible, we would
love to have the blog post by Tuesday next week.
 
Please let me know if he is interested!
Thank you,

need more of our money were already putting the pressure on lawmakers and the

analyzed this effort superbly, saying:
 
"Those who like bigger government and higher taxes will say the sky is falling.
Entrenched interest groups and even some agency heads may say the same thing.
But guess what? It's not. The cuts we've proposed this year amount to 5 percent or
less of agency (appropriated) budgets, and in total amount to about 1 percent of
state spending."

Guest Blog from Atty. Gen. Pruitt
02/07/2014 08:55 AM

Ashley,
 
The Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs was hoping to have Atty. Gen. Pruitt write a guest blog for us
about religious liberty. It only needs to be 250-350 words and we’ll publish it on our blog/social
media. If at all possible, we would love to have the blog post by Tuesday next week.
 
Please let me know if he is interested!
Thank you,

02/05/2014 02:22 PM

We'd like to bring to your attention a special upcoming event in Tulsa highlighting the need to increase
economic freedom and opportunity for Oklahoma families and job-creators by adopting a more
growth-friendly tax policy and reducing the burden of state government.
The Oklahoma Growth & Opportunity Summit will be held Saturday, February 15, on the Lemley
Campus of Tulsa Tech, with the theme, "Making Oklahoma the Place to Prosper," and OCPA staffers
are playing significant roles in the program:
Jonathan Small, OCPA vice president for policy, outlining the steps to be taken to turbocharge
economic freedom in Oklahoma
Steve Anderson, OCPA research fellow and former budget director for Gov. Sam Brownback,
Feb-17-2017 007470

explaining how Kansas is now on a path to zero state income tax
Other panel participants include:
Travis Brown, author of How Money Walks, discussing how, across America, capital is moving
from high-tax locations to low-tax locations
Several of Oklahoma's federal and state officials, including Congressman Jim Bridenstine and
Attorney General Scott Pruitt, emphasizing the importance of economic freedom in our state
and nation
The Growth & Opportunity Summit is being hosted by organizations who often partner with us on
various projects: Americans for Prosperity and OCPA Impact, along with the Tulsa 912 Project.
For tickets and to RSVP, please visit www.OKGrowthSummit.com. Individual tickets are only $12, and

World editorial on AG cost saving effort
02/18/2014 03:09 PM

Good afternoon.
In case you missed it, I wanted to draw your attention to an editorial from the World that lauded the effort
of the AG's Office to get agencies to spend less money on private attorneys and utilize the AG staff more.

Thought you guys would be interested. Let me know if you need any more information.
Thanks,
AC
http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-legal-services/article_93883d3f-f4a5-55e5-9c78b3532e1d5b28.html?mode=print

Editorial: Legal services
By World's Editorials Writers | Posted: Sunday, February 16, 2014 12:00
am
The Oklahoma attorney general's office is not the largest law firm in the state but it
ought to be the largest law firm for the state.
Most state agencies once relied exclusively on the AG's staff for legal advice and
representation. But over the years, state agencies started "lawyering up" - receiving
the statutory green light to hire their own counsel.
By Attorney General Drew Edmondson's last term, ending in 2010, agencies had
about 250 lawyers, and Edmondson unsuccessfully pushed to consolidate legal
services under the AG's office, which is what at least a dozen states do.
At the same time, Rep. Ken Miller, now the state treasurer, also ran into a hornets'
nest affixed to a brick wall when he tried to pass a bill equalizing agency attorneys'
salaries with those of assistant attorney generals. Agencies protected their turf.
Since taking office in 2011, Attorney General Scott Pruitt has made it a priority to
persuade more agencies to use AG staff and to reduce money spent on private
attorney contracts by increasing the number of state agencies that the AG represents.
In fiscal year 2011, the amount spent on private attorney contracts totaled $11.78
million. Since then, that number has dropped impressively by more than $4.25
million.
In recent tough budget years, the Legislature began the process of forced
prioritization that helped direct investment into areas of greatest return. That must
continue. There will be $170 million less money to spend this coming year. Core
services such as common education are gasping for air.
"There's still a great opportunity to eliminate inefficiency in state government," Miller
recently said. "Unfortunately, some of the biggest cost-saving opportunities lie in
Feb-17-2017 007530

areas extremely resistant to change and backed by forces dedicated to maintaining
the status quo."
Two such opportunities are consolidation of the boards and administrations of the
state's seven pension system and of state legal services with the AG's office.
"Both present great opportunities for cost savings that could be better directed into
other core areas. But this will require political courage. Anyone looking for an excuse
for inaction will always find one," Miller said.
Pruitt continues to push for greater utilization of his staff. The AG has 14 new
contracts with agencies. The hourly rate ranges from $75 to $85 an hour. Private
counsel had ranged from $125-$300 an hour. In all, the unit has 62 contracts with
agencies. The staff also provides services at no charge to 28 boards and
commissions.
Yet, issues remain. If an agency wants outside legal services it must go through a
process. If the request is below $20,000, the AG simply records the request but does
not have the authority to approve or disapprove. The AG has authority to approve or
disapprove outside counsel requests above $20,000. That system is being abused
with many agencies, boards, etc., purposely holding requests below $20,000.
Somestimes outside counsel is necessary, Pruitt says, when certain expertise is
required as was the case in the state's water lawsuit. But it makes little sense that
some agencies are turning down the AG's offer to perform work at $75 an hour and
instead seeking outside counsel for $200-plus an hour, even when no specific subject
matter expertise is called for.
The AG's staff once represented almost all of state government, which it could do
again. But to do so the Legislature would need to buck up and make powerful
agencies an offer they can't refuse.

Dear Friends,
 
After General Pruitt’s successful January 2013 Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil Fuels in Oklahoma City, the
Mason Law & Economics Center started making plans to launch an Initiative for Energy and the Environment.  Richard Faulk,

Here’s some more information about the Initiative.  http://www.masonlec.org/programs/initiative-energy-environment
 
Rick and I are putting together the Initiative’s first major event – a Public Policy Conference on “Energy and the Environment: Old
Fuels, New Technologies, and Market Dynamics” to be held at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia on
Monday, April 7.   A draft agenda is attached. 

 

The target audience of this conference is the Washington public policy community plus senior staff from state AG offices.

DRAFT AGENDA -- LEC Public Policy Conference on Energy and the Environment April 7 2014 draft of 2-25-14.pdf

Dear Friends,
 
After General Pruitt’s successful January 2013 Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil Fuels in Oklahoma City, the
Mason Law & Economics Center started making plans to launch an Initiative for Energy and the Environment.  Richard Faulk,
formerly of Gardere in Houston, joined us in July to lead this effort.  You may recall that Rick participated in the OKC summit. 
Here’s some more information about the Initiative.  http://www.masonlec.org/programs/initiative-energy-environment
 
Rick and I are putting together the Initiative’s first major event – a Public Policy Conference on “Energy and the Environment: Old
Fuels, New Technologies, and Market Dynamics” to be held at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia on
Monday, April 7.   A draft agenda is attached. 

 

The target audience of this conference is the Washington public policy community plus senior staff from state AG offices. 

 

All attendees from the OKC Summit are welcome to attend.  There is no registration fee, but we do require that you register in
advance.  Please click here to register:
 
http://www.masonlec.org/events/event/164-lec-public-policy-conference-energy-environment-old-fuels-new-technologies-market

 

The Mason Attorneys General Education Program (AGEP) is subsidizing attendance of AGs and their senior staff.  The AGEP
reimburses transportation expenses and provides group meals and lodging.  To date, 44 representatives from AGs offices are
registered.  We are limiting future registration to AGs and senior staff who attended the OKC Summit.  AGs and senior staff must
register by Friday, March 7.  Please contact Colleen Cherico, Program Assistant AGEP, at ccherico@gmu.edu and
703.993.9964, with any questions.

 

If you are able to join us for the conference, you will be invited to a private dinner on Sunday, April 6 for speakers, AGs and their
senior staff, and our friends from the OKC Summit.
 
Press coverage will be substantial.  All sessions will be live webcast and then posted on our website for future viewing.

 

Finally, if you know of folks on the Hill or in government agencies who should be invited, please send us their contact
information.

After General Pruitt’s successful January 2013 Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil Fuels in Oklahoma City, the
Mason Law & Economics Center started making plans to launch an Initiative for Energy and the Environment.  Richard Faulk,
formerly of Gardere in Houston, joined us in July to lead this effort.  You may recall that Rick participated in the OKC summit. 
Here’s some more information about the Initiative.  http://www.masonlec.org/programs/initiative-energy-environment
 
Rick and I are putting together the Initiative’s first major event – a Public Policy Conference on “Energy and the Environment: Old
Fuels, New Technologies, and Market Dynamics” to be held at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia on
Monday, April 7.   A draft agenda is attached. 

 

The target audience of this conference is the Washington public policy community plus senior staff from state AG offices. 

 

All attendees from the OKC Summit are welcome to attend.  There is no registration fee, but we do require that you register in
advance.  Please click here to register:
 
http://www.masonlec.org/events/event/164-lec-public-policy-conference-energy-environment-old-fuels-new-technologies-market

 

The Mason Attorneys General Education Program (AGEP) is subsidizing attendance of AGs and their senior staff.  The AGEP
reimburses transportation expenses and provides group meals and lodging.  To date, 44 representatives from AGs offices are
registered.  We are limiting future registration to AGs and senior staff who attended the OKC Summit.  AGs and senior staff must
register by Friday, March 7.  Please contact Colleen Cherico, Program Assistant AGEP, at ccherico@gmu.edu and
703.993.9964, with any questions.

 

If you are able to join us for the conference, you will be invited to a private dinner on Sunday, April 6 for speakers, AGs and their
senior staff, and our friends from the OKC Summit.
 
Press coverage will be substantial.  All sessions will be live webcast and then posted on our website for future viewing.

 

Finally, if you know of folks on the Hill or in government agencies who should be invited, please send us their contact
information.

I look forward to seeing in April.
 
Thank you.
